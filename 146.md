# Lack of zero address check may lead to redeployment of contracts.

## Summary
There is no zero address check throughout the contracts in scope. 

## Vulnerability Detail
There are multiple instance where addresses are configured without checking for zero address() in `constructor`, `initialize` and other configuration functions. 
Specially in `constructor`, many immutable addresses are set which are later used in clone and if by mistake these a variables are misconfigured, it might lead to unexpected behavior and in worst case - redeployment of the contracts and all it's clones. 

Although this could be considered as low severity but since all immutables are set without zero address validation, hence should be considered medium.
Note:  Splits is a [hyperstructure](https://dev.docs.0xsplits.xyz/) like Uniswap, it is worth mentioning that this bug was  acknowledged in Uniswap V3 - Check here : https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/audits/tob/audit.pdf 

## Impact
- Redeployment of contracts and it's clones. 
- Unexpected behavior of some implementation.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- All important address variables should have zero address check especially in `constructor` and `initialize` function.
