# The owner can frontrunning call `SwapperImpl.sol#setOracle` to manipulate the price to deceive users

## Summary

The owner can frontrunning call `SwapperImpl.sol#setOracle` to manipulate the price to deceive users

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: splits-swapper/src/SwapperImpl.sol
227     function _transferToTrader(address tokenToBeneficiary_, OracleImpl.QuoteParams[] calldata quoteParams_)
228         internal
229         returns (uint256 amountToBeneficiary, uint256[] memory amountsToBeneficiary)
230     {
231 1>      amountsToBeneficiary = $oracle.getQuoteAmounts(quoteParams_);
232         uint256 length = quoteParams_.length;
233         if (amountsToBeneficiary.length != length) revert Invalid_AmountsToBeneficiary();
```

`SwapperImpl.sol` contract uses discount oracle pricing to incentivize third parties to automatically convert multi-token revenue into a single token & forward to beneficiary.

The price of the user's exchange tokens is calculated by `$oracle`. The owner of `SwapperImpl.sol` contract can set a large discount to attract users to exchange tokens, and when the user calls, the owner frontrunning call `setOracle` function controls the final price.

## Impact

The owner of the `SwapperImpl.sol` contract steals the user's funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to add a certain delay time to the `setOracle` function
