# _getquoteAmount may not return the best quote due to difference in tick size

## Summary

The function _getquoteamount may not return the best quote due to difference in tick sizes in pools.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function _getquoteamount calls the UniswapV3factory to get the pool by entering the 2 tokens and the fee ($defaultFee). These parameters are then used to call getQuoteAtTick. 

Defaultfee is an arbitrary function that can be set by the owner shown here:

However a UniswapV3 pool tick size differs depending on the fee. So there is a chance that the function will not return the best quote for token pairs

## Impact

_getquoteamount may not return the best quote for token pair
