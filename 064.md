# PausableImpl() lacks some sanity checks

## Summary
PausableImpl lacks some sanity checks, including 1) zero address check for ``owner``, 2) checking state of ``$paused`` for function ``setPaused()``. 

## Vulnerability Detail

``PausableImpl`` is an abstract contract that allows the owner to pause/unpause a contract and add the modifier ``pausable`` to a function so that the function can be called only when the contract is not paused. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-splits/blob/main/splits-utils/src/PausableImpl.sol#L9-L62](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-splits/blob/main/splits-utils/src/PausableImpl.sol#L9-L62)

However, there are two issues for the current implementation: 

1. The ``__initPausable()`` lacks the zero address check for ``owner_``. If zero address is entered for ``owner_`` by mistake or on purpose, the ownership will be lost forever. Costing redeployment might be necessary.

```javascript
function __initPausable(address owner_, bool paused_) internal virtual {
        OwnableImpl.__initOwnable(owner_);
        $paused = paused_;
    }
```

2. The ``setPaused()`` performs a blind overwritting to the state of ``$paused`` before checking the previous state, and  emit unnecessary ``SetPaused(paused_)`` event when the new state of ``$paused`` is the same as the old one. 

```javascript
 function setPaused(bool paused_) public virtual onlyOwner {
        $paused = paused_;
        emit SetPaused(paused_);
    }
``` 

A check is needed to avoid making unnecessary state change and redundant event emitting.

## Impact
If zero address is entered for ``owner``, the contract will lost ownership forever and a redeployment is necessary. The unnecessary ``SetPaused(paused_)`` event might unnecessarily trigger some applications that depend on the state of ``$paused`` such as trading strategies.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a zero address check for the input ``owner``. 

``setPaused()`` is revised as follows:

```diff
 function setPaused(bool paused_) public virtual onlyOwner {
+     if($pause == paused_) pausedStateNoChange();

        $paused = paused_;
        emit SetPaused(paused_);
    }
```
