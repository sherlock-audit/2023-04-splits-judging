# An oracle with defaultScaledOfferFactor at zero will offer 100% discounts on all prices

## Summary
The creation of an oracle with a `$defaultScaledOfferFactor` value of zero can lead to the oracle providing a 100% discount on all prices, resulting in potential theft of funds from swappers utilizing the affected oracle.

## Vulnerability Detail
When deploying a new oracle using `UniV3OracleFactory`, the deployer must supply the necessary parameters. However, if a user inadvertently omits these parameters or is unaware of their importance, the `$defaultScaledOfferFactor` will default to zero. Neither the contract comments nor the documentation clarify that a `$defaultScaledOfferFactor` value of zero results in the oracle offering pair prices at no cost, potentially leading to user or developer errors and subsequent theft of funds.

## Impact
An oracle with a `$defaultScaledOfferFactor` value of zero will consistently return a `quoteAmount` of zero when the `getQuoteAmounts` function is called to obtain asset prices. Consequently, any address can deplete the assets of swapper contracts relying on the compromised oracle.

## Code Snippet
These are the return statements of `_getQuoteAmount` that will return zero if `$defaultScaledOfferFactor` is set to zero.

Also, the constructor doesn't have any constraint on setting `$defaultScaledOfferFactor` at zero:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In the `UniV3OracleImpl` constructor, add a `require` statement to guarantee that `$defaultScaledOfferFactor` is not initialized to zero, thus preventing user misconfiguration and potential security issues.
