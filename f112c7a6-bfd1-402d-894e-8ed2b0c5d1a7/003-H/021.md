# Reentrancy Attack in SwapperImpl.sol

## Summary

The flash function in SwapperImpl.sol is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks due to the external call to ISwapperFlashCallback before updating the state.

## Vulnerability Detail

The flash function calls an external contract, ISwapperFlashCallback, before updating the state variable $_payback. If the called contract is malicious, it could call back into the SwapperImpl contract and cause unexpected behavior or steal funds.

## Impact

This vulnerability could lead to loss of funds, unauthorized actions, or other unexpected behaviors in the SwapperImpl contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement reentrancy protection, such as the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern, to prevent reentrancy attacks. Update the state variable $_payback before making the external call to ISwapperFlashCallback.
