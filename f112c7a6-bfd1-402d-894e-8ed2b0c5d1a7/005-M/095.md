# createDiversifier() lacks the check that ensures that the sum of all ``sortedPercentAllocations`` is equal to 100%

## Summary
``createDiversifier()`` lacks the check that ensures that the sum of all ``sortedPercentAllocations`` is equal to 100%.  The impact is that either the incoming tokens will not be sufficient to cover all recipient accounts, or some incoming tokens will be stuck in the account. 

## Vulnerability Detail
``createDiversifier()`` allows a user to create a ``passThroughWallet`` as a diversifier, and then connect it to a list of swappers as recipients.

It is important to check and ensure that the sum of all ``sortedPercentAllocations`` is equal to 100%. However, the function does not have such a check. 

## Impact
Due to the lack of check mentioned above, the incoming tokens will not be sufficient to cover all recipient accounts, or some incoming tokens will be stuck in the account.
