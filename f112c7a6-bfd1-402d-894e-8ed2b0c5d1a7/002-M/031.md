# User will lose assets

## Summary
If user calls the `flash()` function with some ETH and the quote token is not ETH, the protocol  fail to refund the excess ETH to the user, resulting in a loss of funds for the user.


## Vulnerability Detail
The `flash()` function allows third parties to withdraw tokens in return for sending tokenToBeneficiary to beneficiary and the payable keyword signifies that it can receive ETH.
```solidity
function flash(OracleImpl.QuoteParams[] calldata quoteParams_, bytes calldata callbackData_)
        external
        payable
        pausable
    {
        address _tokenToBeneficiary = $tokenToBeneficiary;
        (uint256 amountToBeneficiary, uint256[] memory amountsToBeneficiary) =
            _transferToTrader(_tokenToBeneficiary, quoteParams_);

        ISwapperFlashCallback(msg.sender).swapperFlashCallback({
            tokenToBeneficiary: _tokenToBeneficiary,
            amountToBeneficiary: amountToBeneficiary,
            data: callbackData_
        });

        uint256 excessToBeneficiary = _transferToBeneficiary(_tokenToBeneficiary, amountToBeneficiary);

        emit Flash(msg.sender, quoteParams_, _tokenToBeneficiary, amountsToBeneficiary, excessToBeneficiary);
    }

```

Inside the function, the protocol calls the `_transferToTrader` to transfers funds to the trader for executing trades.
Next,the function  calls the swapperFlashCallback function of the ISwapperFlashCallback interface on the msg.sender object.
Finally, the function calls `_transferToBeneficiary()` function to transfers any remaining funds to the beneficiary and returns the amount transferred.
```solidity
function _transferToBeneficiary(address tokenToBeneficiary_, uint256 amountToBeneficiary_)
        internal
        returns (uint256 excessToBeneficiary)
    {
        address _beneficiary = $beneficiary;
        if (tokenToBeneficiary_._isETH()) {
            if ($_payback < amountToBeneficiary_) {
                revert InsufficientFunds_FromTrader();
            }
            $_payback = 0;

            // send eth to beneficiary
            uint256 ethBalance = address(this).balance;
            excessToBeneficiary = ethBalance - amountToBeneficiary_;
            _beneficiary.safeTransferETH(ethBalance);
        } else {
            tokenToBeneficiary_.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, _beneficiary, amountToBeneficiary_);

            // flush excess tokenToBeneficiary to beneficiary
            excessToBeneficiary = ERC20(tokenToBeneficiary_).balanceOf(address(this));
            if (excessToBeneficiary > 0) {
                tokenToBeneficiary_.safeTransfer(_beneficiary, excessToBeneficiary);
            }
        }
    }
```
However ,as the code above we find that if user calls this function with some ETH and the quote token is not ETH, the protocol  fail to refund the excess ETH to the user, resulting in a loss of funds for the user.
