# Consistent leak of value via UniV3TWAP - Most Tokens are liquid only against one token

## Summary

Single Pair Pricing via UniV3 is very likely to leak value for the majority of pairs.

Most tokens are liquid against a limited range of other tokens.
The UniV3 Twap reading is performed on a single pair.
Most tokens will offer a valid price vs only one token, but will offer a highly discounted and / or manipulatable price vs most others.

This means that most tokens will be underpriced, leaving value on the table for Arbitrageurs and making the streams at risk

--

Common examples are Stablecoins vs ETH vs Protocol Tokens

Stablecoins such as USDC are liquid only with ETH and other stablecoins
LUSD for example is highly illiquid with even wBTC, let alone other tokens
Most Protocol Tokens (e.g. AAVE, Balancer, etc..) are liquid only against ETH, and have very high price impact when swapped against even USDC

## Vulnerability Detail

Most direct pairs will end up offering a lower value as the TWAP Library will not look for the optimal route, but a direct one, causing each Swap to incur High Price impact, losing value for users at the advantage of arbitrageurs.

## Impact

For example, LUSD and wBTC needs to be routed through USDC

Another more classic example is also protocol tokens, (most), for example ENS to USDC requires WETH as supporting route

This applies to the majority of protocol tokens, which would be offered via grants, or streams, making the TWAP impractical and potentially risky


Even wBTC USDC only has around 5 MLN in TVL on it's highest Liquidity Pool
```python
'0x99ac8cA7087fA4A2A1FB6357269965A2014ABc35'
wbtc.balanceOf("0x99ac8cA7087fA4A2A1FB6357269965A2014ABc35")
106739833273
106739833273 / 10e8
106.739833273 ## 106 BTC is roughly 2.5MLN USD * 2 = 5MLN
```

## Code Snippet

Pools being used to directly check for quotes lead to a majority of pairs that are illiquid due to most tokens having only one (typically ETH) pair that is liquid

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use Chainlink feeds for pricing or limit TWAP to highly resilient pairs, that have at least $100 MLN in liquidity
