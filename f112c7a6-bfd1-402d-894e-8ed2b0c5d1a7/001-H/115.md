# Uniswap pool might need a hop token to give the most accurate price

## Summary
When oracle checks the price, it only checks a single pool with a single fee tier. However, pool might not be existed or it might be illiquid hence, it needs a hop token to get the price accurately.
## Vulnerability Detail
Assume the swapper contract holds some ARB tokens, and the beneficiary of the swapper is LINK. The swapper will call the oracle to check if there is a pool between ARB-LINK; if not, it will revert. Currently, there are no pools for this pair. However, if someone were to swap ARB -> ETH -> LINK, that trade would be successful since ETH would be used as a hop token.

Similarly, assume the swapper has YFI and needs to convert it to LINK. Currently, the YFI-LINK pair has very low liquidity (1$). Such a trade would give a wrong price and could lead to problems.
## Impact
This finding is somewhat similar to another finding I submitted. The aim of this separate finding is that it is mainly focused on obtaining the best prices rather than manipulation of low-liquidity pools. Therefore, I'll label this as medium.

Example:
When getting a quote of X respect to Y:

if X-Y pool has 500K liquidity and X-Z && Z-Y has 10M liquidity, best price quoted will be X -> Z -> Y rather than X -> Y directly

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow oracle contract to have 2 modes or add another variable to PairOverride such that indicating whether to check directly X-Y pair or X-Z-Y.

The most popular pool pair is ETH, this can be used on Oracle level such as if the beneficiary token is something like YFI-LINK-AAVE-UNI 

quote it as:
 base token -> ETH -> beneficiary token
or
base token -> beneficiary token

default path (x-z-y or x-y) can be determined when initializing the oracle and PairOverride can be used for specific cases.
