# No Input Validation for Length of Arrays in SwapperImpl.sol

## Summary

In the flash function of SwapperImpl.sol, there is no input validation for the length of quoteParams_ array, which could lead to unpredictable behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Detail

The flash function does not validate the length of the quoteParams_ array, which can lead to unexpected behavior if an attacker submits an array with an excessive length, potentially causing a DoS attack or other security vulnerabilities.

## Impact

This vulnerability could lead to unpredictable behavior, potentially impacting the availability and functionality of the platform.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding input validation for the length of the quoteParams_ array to ensure it does not exceed a safe limit. This will help mitigate potential DoS attacks or other security vulnerabilities that may arise from processing excessively large arrays.

```solidity
require(quoteParams_.length <= MAX_ARRAY_LENGTH, "Array length exceeds the limit");
```

Where `MAX_ARRAY_LENGTH` is a predefined constant that represents the maximum allowed length for the quoteParams_ array.
