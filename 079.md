# Denial of Service - execCalls at splits-utils could grow indefinitely

## Summary

If the length of the arbitrary calls within `Call[] calldata calls_` grow indefinitely, the owner can lead to expensive transactions and effectively denial of service while iterating through the whole array values. 

## Vulnerability Detail

If an admin executes a longer arbitrary calls, then other users should wait until all of those calls are completed. If the calls to `execCalls` functions are bundled with some other functions, those additional functions may have to may, or may never get executed due to gas grieving. The wait can also lead to loss of funds.

This attack is possible as other operations are included by bundlers from the UserOperation mempool into the Ethereum block.

## Impact

Function call has to be waited, or may never get executed.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function execCalls(Call[] calldata calls_)
        external
        payable
        onlyOwner
        returns (uint256 blockNumber, bytes[] memory returnData)
    {
        blockNumber = block.number;
        uint256 length = calls_.length;
        returnData = new bytes[](length);

        bool success;
        for (uint256 i; i < length;) {
            Call calldata calli = calls_[i];
            (success, returnData[i]) = calli.to.call{value: calli.value}(calli.data);
            require(success, string(returnData[i]));

            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }

        emit ExecCalls(calls_);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the code to follow the ETH-standard for [Account Abstraction](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/commit/4fef857019dc2efbc415ac9fc549b222b07131ef). It will help to ensure the the remaining gas is more than sufficient to cover the rest of the remaining set of operational calls.
