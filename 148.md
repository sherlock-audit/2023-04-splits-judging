# Use of block.number in wallet implmentation may cause issues on other chains.

## Summary
block.number on other chains is not similar as on mainnet.
## Vulnerability Detail
using block.number directly in the wallet may cause issues in future integrations due to following reasons:
1. block number on chains like arbitrum and optimism are not synced on the mainnet and they donot recommend using the block.number directly on the contracts deployed on these chains
2. As we know from the legacy contracts that splits is multi chain ecosystem, this should be considered.
3. wallet implementation is absolutely necessary and code part of the system and will be used in the future integrations, so is the block numbers are out of synced or unexpected it can lead to multiple, platform specific problems.

The guide on block.number for arbitrum and optimism can be found at following links:

## Impact

Future integrations done through the wallet implementation can be rigged.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do the thorough analysis and devise a proper mechanism to propely handle this for different chains.
