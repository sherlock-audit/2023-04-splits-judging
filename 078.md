# Trader could possibly lose funds (i.e. pay more quoteToken)

## Summary
The trader has no way to set a maximum inputAmount. If for example the price returned by the Oracle (any Oracle) is wrong or inaccurate which is possible, the trader will pay more quoteToken than what they expect.

## Vulnerability Detail
`_getQuoteAmount` method gets **unscaledAmountToBeneficiary** from Uniswap oracle.

```solidity
	uint256 unscaledAmountToBeneficiary = OracleLibrary.getQuoteAtTick({
		tick: arithmeticMeanTick,
		baseAmount: quoteParams_.baseAmount,
		baseToken: cqp.cBase,
		quoteToken: cqp.cQuote
	});
```

It is possible that the price is stale or wrong for and as there is no maximum inputAmount check engorced as a safety, Trader could possibly pay more quoteToken due to the lack of the safety check. i.e. Swapper owner will receive more quote tokens and the trader will receive less which is a loss to the trader.

*Note: this is applicable to any other oracle and not limited to Uniswap oracle.*

## Impact
Trader will receive less tokens and the Swapper owner will receive more. In other words, Trader will have a loss of funds.

## Recommendation
Add a parameter maxInputAmount to `flash` method to allow the trader to set a max input amount (i.e. max quote amount) to be transferred from him/her. Then If amountsToBeneficiary is greater than maxInputAmount, revert.
