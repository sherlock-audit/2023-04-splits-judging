# `OwnableImpl.sol#transferOwnership` may transfer onwer to an address that does not have the ability to receive

## Summary

`OwnableImpl.sol#transferOwnership` may transfer onwer to an address that does not have the ability to receive

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: splits-utils/src/OwnableImpl.sol
 45     function transferOwnership(address owner_) public virtual onlyOwner {
 46         $owner = owner_;
 47         emit OwnershipTransferred(msg.sender, owner_);
 48     }
```

The `transferOwnership` function of the `OwnableImpl.sol` contract can transfer the owner to a new address. The problem here is that the new onwer may be an address that does not have the ability to execute the owner permission (for example, a contract address that has not implemented related functions)

## Impact

The admin function of the contract will become uncallable.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to add an function to allow the receiver of the owner to actively receive the identity of the owner.
