# The owner of diversifier can not modify the Split, change the oracles, pause the Swappers

## Summary
As we read in [docs](https://dev.docs.0xsplits.xyz/templates/diversifier#how-it-works):

> Each Diversified can be owned, which means the owner has full control of the deployment. The owner may modify the Split, change the oracles, pause the Swappers, and execute arbitrary transactions at their will. We recommend removing the owner or making it a multisig if this contract is being used in any trustless setting.

in DiversifierFactory.sol, the diversifier contract address is passed as controller of split and owner of swappers. So the owner has no control over them. 

## Vulnerability Detail
in `DiversifierFactory.createDiversifier()` :
```solidity
function createDiversifier(CreateDiversifierParams calldata params_) external returns (address diversifier) {
        // create pass-through wallet w {this} as owner & no passThrough
        PassThroughWalletImpl passThroughWallet = passThroughWalletFactory.createPassThroughWallet(
            PassThroughWalletImpl.InitParams({owner: address(this), paused: params_.paused, passThrough: ADDRESS_ZERO})
        );
        diversifier = address(passThroughWallet);

        // parse oracle params for swapper-recipients
        OracleImpl oracle = _parseOracleParams(diversifier, params_.oracleParams);

        // create split w diversifier (pass-through wallet) as controller
        (address[] memory sortedAccounts, uint32[] memory sortedPercentAllocations) =
            _parseRecipientParams(diversifier, oracle, params_.recipientParams);
        address passThroughSplit = splitMain.createSplit({
            accounts: sortedAccounts,
            percentAllocations: sortedPercentAllocations,
            distributorFee: 0,
            controller: diversifier
        });

        // set split address as passThrough & transfer ownership from factory
        passThroughWallet.setPassThrough(passThroughSplit);
        passThroughWallet.transferOwnership(params_.owner);

        emit CreateDiversifier(diversifier);
    }
```

1. The pasThrough is cloned and address of it is set in diversifier
2. In _parseOracleParams() the diversifier is set as owner of each swapper that is created:
    ```solidity
    swapperFactory.createSwapper(
                        SwapperFactory.CreateSwapperParams({
                            owner: diversifier_,...
    ```
3. In SwapperImpl.sol we see that onlyOwner can setOracle() or pause swappers by calling setPaused().
4. Since the diversifier contract address is set as owner of swappers, there is no possibility to change the settings of swappers

The same is true for Split since the diversifier is set as controller of it

## Impact
The owner of diversifier can not modify the Split, change the oracles, pause the Swappers

            distributorFee: 0,
-           controller: diversifier
+          controller: params_.owner
        });
```
```diff

                ? recipientParams.account
                : address(
                    swapperFactory.createSwapper(
                        SwapperFactory.CreateSwapperParams({
-                           owner: diversifier_,
