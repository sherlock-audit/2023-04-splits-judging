# Lack of reentrancy protection

## Summary

Lack of reentrancy protection in core contract `WalletImpl`

## Vulnerability Detail

To send ETH you use the next code:
```solidity
(success, returnData[i]) = calli.to.call{value: calli.value}(calli.data);
```
There is no gas limit, so it's easy to re-enter function if `calli.to` is malicious user's contract
It leaves room for vulnerability in contracts inherited from `WalletImpl`

## Impact

Because this vulnerable function is not used now, I chose "Medium" severity. 
Yes, it's possible to add reentrancy protection in contracts inherited from `WalletImpl`. But you write core-function to reuse in other contracts, so it will be better to add protection in the core contract. 

And you already existing modifier `onlyOwner` doesn't resolve the problem, because there may be new contract managing you contact inherited from `WalletImpl`. And it may be required to give ownership to that new manager contract
