# Use of wrong versions of solady safeTransferLib leads to not clearing the dirty bits.

## Summary
The old version doesnâ€™t clear possible dirty upper 96 bits of the addresses. This has been fixed in the latest versions.
## Vulnerability Detail
The solady SafeTransferLib did not clear the other 12 bytes / 96 bits that are stored with the address which makes it possible that there is dirty data stored in the same slot.

This issue have been fixed in the latest commit here:

## Impact
`extcodesize`, `call`, `staticcall` and other EVM opcodes that take in an address are agnostic to dirty upper 96 bits.
