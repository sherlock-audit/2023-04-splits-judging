# PercentAllocation total can be > or < 100%  as there is no verification

## Summary

When creating or allocating swappers regarding tokens there is no check that owner has in fact allocated exactly 100% of which tokens he wants to diversify

## Vulnerability Detail

In `_parseRecipientParams()` from DiversifierFactory.sol, a loop is made regarding the length of `RecipientParams[]` array in argument.
This array comes from a call through `createDiversifier()` function which is in charge of creating swappers and sort beneficiaries account and percentage allocated to each.
From my understanding a diversifier will be used to allocate the good percentage of tokens coming from the PassThroughWallet through good swappers that will send final tokens to beneficiaries.
In the `_parseRecipientParams()` loop that checks if a swapper creation is needed or not, account and percentAllocation are packed together for better gas usage.
Then the packed account/percentageAllocations is sorted and sent back to the main function `createDiversifier()` which will use this sorted array to create a split using `createSplit()` 
**However there is no check if the final value of all the recipientParams_[].percentage is in fact equal to 100**

## Impact

As Diversifier creator can be malicious or can do an error by setting percentages above or below 100%, it could lead to funds not correctly diversified and/or stuck in the split contract when diversifier send percentage amount to each swappers.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/main/splits-diversifier/src/DiversifierFactory.sol#L108-L129
```solidity
        for (uint256 i; i < length;) {
            RecipientParams calldata recipientParams = recipientParams_[i];
            // use recipient account or, if empty, create a new swapper owned by diversifier using oracle & other args
            address account = (recipientParams.account._isNotEmpty())
                ? recipientParams.account
                : address(
                    swapperFactory.createSwapper(
                        SwapperFactory.CreateSwapperParams({
                            owner: diversifier_,
                            paused: false,
                            beneficiary: recipientParams.createSwapperParams.beneficiary,
                            tokenToBeneficiary: recipientParams.createSwapperParams.tokenToBeneficiary,
                            oracleParams: swapperOracleParams
                        })
                    )
                );
            packedRecipients[i] = account._pack(recipientParams.percentAllocation);

            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a check after the loop to ensure that total percentage is 100% :
```solidity
        uint256 totalPercentage =0;
        for (uint256 i; i < length;) {
            RecipientParams calldata recipientParams = recipientParams_[i];
            // use recipient account or, if empty, create a new swapper owned by diversifier using oracle & other args
            address account = (recipientParams.account._isNotEmpty())
                ? recipientParams.account
                : address(
                    swapperFactory.createSwapper(
                        SwapperFactory.CreateSwapperParams({
                            owner: diversifier_,
                            paused: false,
                            beneficiary: recipientParams.createSwapperParams.beneficiary,
                            tokenToBeneficiary: recipientParams.createSwapperParams.tokenToBeneficiary,
                            oracleParams: swapperOracleParams
                        })
                    )
                );
            packedRecipients[i] = account._pack(recipientParams.percentAllocation);
            totalPercentage += recipientParams.percentAllocation
 
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
        require(totalPercentage == 100_00_00,"bad allocation");
```
