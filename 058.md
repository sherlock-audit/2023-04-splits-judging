# Some ERC20 tokens deduct a fee on transfer

## Summary
Some ERC20 token implementations have a fee that is charged on each token transfer. This means that the transferred amount isn't exactly what the receiver will get.
The protocol currently uses any ERC20 tokens:

ERC20: any non-rebasing

## Vulnerability Detail
See Summary

## Impact
The transferred amount isn't exactly what the receiver will get.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Improve support for fee on transfer type of ERC20. When pulling funds from the user using safeTransferFrom and safeTransfer the usual approach is to compare balances pre/post transfer, like so:
This is example(chek balance) :
```solidity
uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
IERC20(token).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
uint256 transferred = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore;
```
