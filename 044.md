# [M-1] Using UniV3Oracle could allow third parties to get % fee from beneficiary accounts for free.

## Summary

When a beneficiary account receives tokens that go through the swapper, it can pay a percentage reduction determined by `scaledOfferFactor` to incentivize third parties to do the swap. However, this reduction also applies to the partial amount of tokens that do not need swapping, which is unfair to the beneficiary account.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a diversifier is created, it can specify which beneficiary address will receive which token (tokenToBeneficiary) after going through the swapper contracts. If the diversifier receives a token that matches the `tokenToBeneficiary`, a third party can front-run and call `SwapperImpl.flash` and gain the incentive amount = `quoteParams_.baseAmount * (1 - po.scaledOfferFactor) / PERCENTAGE_SCALE.`

This can happen because `scaledOfferFactor` is still applied even when `baseToken = quoteToken`.

```javascript
        if (cqp.cBase == cqp.cQuote) {
            return quoteParams_.baseAmount * po.scaledOfferFactor / PERCENTAGE_SCALE;
        }
```

The scaledOfferFactor is usually set to a value below 100% (for example, 99_00_00 = 99% = 1% discount to oracle) (as shown in the test case). This means that the third party gets 1% for free (no swap is carried out).

POC:

- A diversifier is created with the following template. Split 
 + 40% to swapper: USDC to taxes.alice.eth
 + 60% to swapper: ETH to alice.eth

If the diversifier receives ETH, the third party just needs to front-run others and call `SwapperImpl.flash` in the ETH swapper contract and set `base = quote = address(0)`, and receive 1% without doing any swapping work at the expense of the beneficiary address.

## Impact

Beneficiary accounts get less payment despite no swapping work needed. Third parties receive funds from swapper contracts and send them to beneficiary accounts and earn % fee (which is designed to reward swap work).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Set no scaledOfferFactor if cBase = cQuote. A keeper or user can call flash, pay a little gas and avoid paying `scaledOfferFactor` %

```diff
        if (cqp.cBase == cqp.cQuote) {
-           return quoteParams_.baseAmount * po.scaledOfferFactor / PERCENTAGE_SCALE;
+           return quoteParams_.baseAmount;
        }
```
