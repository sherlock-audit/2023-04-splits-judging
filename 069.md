# Malicious actor can grieve traders by frontrunning flash() and changing balance of one token

## Summary
When a trader uses the `swapperImpl.flash()` function, the `flash` function internally calls `_transferToTrader()` to transfer tokens to the trader and receive an equivalent amount of `beneficiaryToken`. In this process, the function `transferToTrader` first checks if there are enough tokens available in the contract to transfer to the trader. If there is not enough balance, the function reverts with an `InsufficientFunds_InContract` error:
```solidity
if (amountToTrader > tokenToTrader._balanceOf(address(this))) {
                revert InsufficientFunds_InContract();
            }
```
However, a malicious actor may try to front-run the trader's transaction by calling the `flash` function for one of the tokens before the trader can do so. This would lead to a reduction in the balance of that token in the contract, causing the trader's `flash` function to revert due to insufficient funds. 

For example, suppose a trader intends to use the `flash` function to swap token A for token B. Before the trader can execute the transaction, a malicious actor transfers a large amount of token A out of the contract. As a result, when the trader's `flash` function tries to transfer token A to them, there is not enough balance in the contract, causing the function to revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. swapperImp has 1000 USDT, 1 WETH, and 200 ADA tokens
2. trader wants to use the `flash` function to swap all the above tokens and send ETH to the beneficiary.
3. A for token B. Before the trader can execute the transaction, a malicious actor frontruns and calls `flash()` to swap 1 wei of USDT with ETH.
4. The balance of USDT in the swapperImp becomes (1000-1wei) USDT.
5. Now the transaction of the trader flash() will revert because of the error in transferring tokens:
    ```solidity
    if (amountToTrader > tokenToTrader._balanceOf(address(this))) {
                revert InsufficientFunds_InContract();
            }
    ```
    1000 USDT > (1000-1wei) USDT

So **malicious actor can prevent traders to call flash(), just by spending tiny amount of one token.**

## Impact
Malicious actor can grieve traders by frontrunning the SwapperImpl.falsh()

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
### solution one:
skip one token that its amount is not enough:
```diff
if (amountToTrader > tokenToTrader._balanceOf(address(this))) { //@audit grieve by flashing 1 token
-               revert InsufficientFunds_InContract();
+              i++;
+              continue;
            }
```

### solution two:
cut off the amounts:
```diff
+uint256  tokenBalance = tokenToTrader._balanceOf(address(this));
+uint256 amountToBeni = amountsToBeneficiary[i];
if (amountToTrader > tokenBalance) { 
-               revert InsufficientFunds_InContract();
+              amountToTrader = tokenBalance;
+              amountToBeni = (amountToBeni * tokenBalance) / amountToTrader; 
            }
-amountToBeneficiary += amountsToBeneficiary[i];
+amountToBeneficiary += amountToBeni;
```
