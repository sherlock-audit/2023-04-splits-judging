# the amountToBeneficiary_ is properly converted if the tokenToBeneficiary is ETH and the quote token is not ETH.

## Summary

the amountToBeneficiary_ usage and not properly converted is if the tokenToBeneficiary is ETH and the quote token is not ETH.

## Vulnerability Detail

user can call flash function

```solidity    
function flash(OracleImpl.QuoteParams[] calldata quoteParams_, bytes calldata callbackData_)
        external
        payable
        pausable
    {
        address _tokenToBeneficiary = $tokenToBeneficiary;
        (uint256 amountToBeneficiary, uint256[] memory amountsToBeneficiary) =
            _transferToTrader(_tokenToBeneficiary, quoteParams_);

        ISwapperFlashCallback(msg.sender).swapperFlashCallback({
            tokenToBeneficiary: _tokenToBeneficiary,
            amountToBeneficiary: amountToBeneficiary,
            data: callbackData_
        });

        uint256 excessToBeneficiary = _transferToBeneficiary(_tokenToBeneficiary, amountToBeneficiary);

        emit Flash(msg.sender, quoteParams_, _tokenToBeneficiary, amountsToBeneficiary, excessToBeneficiary);
    }
    function flash(OracleImpl.QuoteParams[] calldata quoteParams_, bytes calldata callbackData_)
        external
        payable
        pausable
    {
        address _tokenToBeneficiary = $tokenToBeneficiary;
        (uint256 amountToBeneficiary, uint256[] memory amountsToBeneficiary) =
            _transferToTrader(_tokenToBeneficiary, quoteParams_);

        ISwapperFlashCallback(msg.sender).swapperFlashCallback({
            tokenToBeneficiary: _tokenToBeneficiary,
            amountToBeneficiary: amountToBeneficiary,
            data: callbackData_
        });

        uint256 excessToBeneficiary = _transferToBeneficiary(_tokenToBeneficiary, amountToBeneficiary);

        emit Flash(msg.sender, quoteParams_, _tokenToBeneficiary, amountsToBeneficiary, excessToBeneficiary);
    }
```

first we query the oracle

```solidity
function _transferToTrader(address tokenToBeneficiary_, OracleImpl.QuoteParams[] calldata quoteParams_)
	internal
	returns (uint256 amountToBeneficiary, uint256[] memory amountsToBeneficiary)
{
	amountsToBeneficiary = $oracle.getQuoteAmounts(quoteParams_);
```

and the amountToBeneficiary is a array of uint256 integer that make sure the beneificiary is properly paid because the trader is using the base token

```solidity
amountToBeneficiary += amountsToBeneficiary[i];
```

however, later when the code tries to settle the beneficiary payment,

```solidity
function _transferToBeneficiary(address tokenToBeneficiary_, uint256 amountToBeneficiary_)
	internal
	returns (uint256 excessToBeneficiary)
{
	address _beneficiary = $beneficiary;
	if (tokenToBeneficiary_._isETH()) {
		if ($_payback < amountToBeneficiary_) {
			revert InsufficientFunds_FromTrader();
		}
		$_payback = 0;

		// send eth to beneficiary
		uint256 ethBalance = address(this).balance;
		excessToBeneficiary = ethBalance - amountToBeneficiary_;
		_beneficiary.safeTransferETH(ethBalance);
	} 
```

the amountToBeneficiary_ maybe not right in the tokenToBenficiary is ETH because the base token and quote token does not have to be ETH

```solidity
uint256 unscaledAmountToBeneficiary = OracleLibrary.getQuoteAtTick({
	tick: arithmeticMeanTick,
	baseAmount: quoteParams_.baseAmount,
	baseToken: cqp.cBase,
	quoteToken: cqp.cQuote
});

return unscaledAmountToBeneficiary * po.scaledOfferFactor / PERCENTAGE_SCALE;
```

the unscaledAmountToBeneficiary is in quoteToken unit and quoteToken unit does not has to equal ETH.

for example, base token can be USDC and the quote token beneficiary amount can be in USDT, but if the beneficiairy token is ETH, the amount in the unit of USDT is wrongly used as the unit of ETH in  amountToBeneficiary_ when paying the beneificary because the code does not conver the amoutn of USDT (quote token) to ETH amount before paying the  beneificary

## Impact

the amountToBeneficiary_ is wrongly paid to the beneifiary.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol convert the quote token to ETH / WETH amount if the okenToBeneficiary is ETH and the quote token is not ETH.
