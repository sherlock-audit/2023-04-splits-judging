# Loss of funds via payback() external function found in swapperImpl.sol

## Summary
Possible Loss of funds via `payback()` external function found in swapperImpl.sol 

## Vulnerability Detail
`payback()` function has its visibility set to external and it also has the `payable` keyword which means it can receive Ether.

The `payback()` function isn't supposed to be used outside `swapperFlashCallback` because it can lead to loss of funds for users as its only used to track ETH payback in flash.

## Impact
An unsuspecting user can send ETH to `payback()`, its an external function and has the `payable` keyword and he will end up losing all his funds.
