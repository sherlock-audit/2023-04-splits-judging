# Misleading naming could result in not functional contracts and wrong assumptions

## Summary

**Likelihood**
Medium since it requires wrong assumptions in the front-end implementation or users directly interacting with the protocol

**Impact**
Medium because the UX can become terrible

## Vulnerability Detail

Wrong naming can give wrong assumptions and can lead to not functional contract if the front-end does not predict this strange behavior.

## Impact

The event creates wrong assumptions that the contract is paused when it is not (only the argument is different). The function `setPaused` on the other side suppose to only pause but actually can unpause as well.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
51: function setPaused(bool paused_) public virtual onlyOwner {
52:     $paused = paused_;
53:     emit SetPaused(paused_);
54:}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider renaming the `setPaused` function and `SetPaused` event. Better alternatives are `setPausingState` for the function name and adding 2 separate events - `Paused` and `UnPaused`.
