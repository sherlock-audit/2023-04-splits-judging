# Beneficiary can incur losses due to slippage during a flash call

## Summary

Beneficiary can incur losses due to slippage during a flash call

## Vulnerability Detail

When `SwapperImpl::flash` is called, the `amountsToBeneficiary` is determined by the oracle using the `getQuoteAmounts` function.

```solidity
        amountsToBeneficiary = $oracle.getQuoteAmounts(quoteParams_);
        uint256 length = quoteParams_.length;
        if (amountsToBeneficiary.length != length) revert Invalid_AmountsToBeneficiary();
```

The issue is that there is no slippage protection to ensure that `amountsToBeneficiary` is within a certain minimum limit. 

This exposes the calculation of the `amountsToBeneficiary` to attacks including flashloans where the trader gains an advantage and the beneficiary loses out by getting a lower value of  `amountsToBeneficiary`.

## Impact

Beneficiary loses value due to lack of slippage protection.

## Recommendation

Some form of slippage protection should be implemented which may require a redesign of how trades are done.
