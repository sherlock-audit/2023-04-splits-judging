# execCalls() fails to check that msg.value is equal to the sum of all calli.value.

## Summary
``execCalls()`` fails to check that ``msg.value`` is equal to the sum of all ``calli.value``.  As a result, the user might overpay or underpay when calling ``execCalls()``. In the case of underpayment, it essentially steals the funds from the contracts. In the case of overpayment, the user will lose funds to the contract. 

## Vulnerability Detail
``WalletImpl`` is an abstract contract that allows a user to make a bunch of calls to external contracts within one transaction to save gas. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-splits/blob/main/splits-utils/src/WalletImpl.sol#L9-L66](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-splits/blob/main/splits-utils/src/WalletImpl.sol#L9-L66)

However, it fails to check that ``msg.value`` is equal to the sum of all ``calli.value``. It also fails to check the existence of each contract that it tries to call. In this report, I will focus on the former. 

    function execCalls(Call[] calldata calls_)
        external
        payable
        onlyOwner
        returns (uint256 blockNumber, bytes[] memory returnData)
    {
        blockNumber = block.number;
        uint256 length = calls_.length;
        returnData = new bytes[](length);

        bool success;
        for (uint256 i; i < length;) {
            Call calldata calli = calls_[i];
            (success, returnData[i]) = calli.to.call{value: calli.value}(calli.data);
            require(success, string(returnData[i]));

            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }

        emit ExecCalls(calls_);
    }

## Impact
 As a result, the user might overpay or underpay when calling ``execCalls()``. In the case of underpayment, it essentially steals the funds from the contracts. In the case of overpayment, the user will lose funds to the contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check check that ``msg.value`` is equal to the sum of all ``calli.value``. 
```diff
 function execCalls(Call[] calldata calls_)
        external
        payable
        onlyOwner
        returns (uint256 blockNumber, bytes[] memory returnData)
    {
        blockNumber = block.number;
        uint256 length = calls_.length;
        returnData = new bytes[](length);

+     uint256 totalVal;
+     for(uint256 i; i<length) totalVal += calls_[i].value;
+     if(msg.value != totalVal) revert OverpayOrUnderPay();


        bool success;
        for (uint256 i; i < length;) {
            Call calldata calli = calls_[i];
            (success, returnData[i]) = calli.to.call{value: calli.value}(calli.data);
            require(success, string(returnData[i]));

            unchecked {

            }
        }

        emit ExecCalls(calls_);
