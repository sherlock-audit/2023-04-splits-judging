# The cost of the price manipulation is low for newly created pool with different fee setting

## Summary

The cost of the price manipulation is low for newly created pool with different fee setting

## Vulnerability Detail

Price oracle is important because it the price oracle report wrong price or stale price or subject to price manipulation, the caller of the function flash to get the price at discount while not paying the token beneficiary properly

```solidity
function flash(OracleImpl.QuoteParams[] calldata quoteParams_, bytes calldata callbackData_)
	external
	payable
	pausable
{
	address _tokenToBeneficiary = $tokenToBeneficiary;
	(uint256 amountToBeneficiary, uint256[] memory amountsToBeneficiary) =
		_transferToTrader(_tokenToBeneficiary, quoteParams_);

	ISwapperFlashCallback(msg.sender).swapperFlashCallback({
		tokenToBeneficiary: _tokenToBeneficiary,
		amountToBeneficiary: amountToBeneficiary,
		data: callbackData_
	});

	uint256 excessToBeneficiary = _transferToBeneficiary(_tokenToBeneficiary, amountToBeneficiary);

	emit Flash(msg.sender, quoteParams_, _tokenToBeneficiary, amountsToBeneficiary, excessToBeneficiary);
}
```

this is calling

```solidity
function _transferToTrader(address tokenToBeneficiary_, OracleImpl.QuoteParams[] calldata quoteParams_)
	internal
	returns (uint256 amountToBeneficiary, uint256[] memory amountsToBeneficiary)
{
	amountsToBeneficiary = $oracle.getQuoteAmounts(quoteParams_);
```

and the function call $oracle.getQuoteAmounts use Uniswap V3 Twap oracle

```solidity
function _getQuoteAmount(QuoteParams calldata quoteParams_) internal view returns (uint256) {
	ConvertedQuotePair memory cqp = quoteParams_.quotePair._convert(_convertToken);
	SortedConvertedQuotePair memory scqp = cqp._sort();

	PairOverride memory po = _getPairOverride(scqp);
	if (po.scaledOfferFactor == 0) {
		po.scaledOfferFactor = $defaultScaledOfferFactor;
	}

	// skip oracle if converted tokens are equal
	if (cqp.cBase == cqp.cQuote) {
		return quoteParams_.baseAmount * po.scaledOfferFactor / PERCENTAGE_SCALE;
	}

	if (po.fee == 0) {
		po.fee = $defaultFee;
	}
	if (po.period == 0) {
		po.period = $defaultPeriod;
	}

	address pool = uniswapV3Factory.getPool(scqp.cToken0, scqp.cToken1, po.fee);
	if (pool == address(0)) {
		revert Pool_DoesNotExist();
	}

	// reverts if period is zero or > oldest observation
	(int24 arithmeticMeanTick,) = OracleLibrary.consult({pool: pool, secondsAgo: po.period});

	uint256 unscaledAmountToBeneficiary = OracleLibrary.getQuoteAtTick({
		tick: arithmeticMeanTick,
		baseAmount: quoteParams_.baseAmount,
		baseToken: cqp.cBase,
		quoteToken: cqp.cQuote
	});

	return unscaledAmountToBeneficiary * po.scaledOfferFactor / PERCENTAGE_SCALE;
}
```

note the code below:

```solidity
	address pool = uniswapV3Factory.getPool(scqp.cToken0, scqp.cToken1, po.fee);
	if (pool == address(0)) {
		revert Pool_DoesNotExist();
	}
```

the Uniswap Pool is derived from token0 and token1, the token0 and token1 are sorted and has determinstic output,

however, the po.fee can be gamed.

According to https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/protocol/fees#pool-fees-tiers

> Uniswap v3 introduces multiple pools for each token pair, each with a different swapping fee. Liquidity providers may initially create pools at three fee levels: 0.05%, 0.30%, and 1%. More fee levels may be added by UNI governance, e.g. the 0.01% fee level added by this governance proposal in November 2021, as executed here.

User can create Uniswap V3 Pool with three fee setting, 0.05%, 0.3% and 1%, please note that the token0 and token1 with 0.05% fee setting or 0.3% setting are different pool and has different liquidity and return different price!

If the po.fee is set and the pool with token0 and token1 and po.fee does not exists, the transaction revert.

However, a user can front-run the price oracle and create the token0 and token1 and po.fee and add liqudity to set the initial price. given that the newly created liquidity pool price is low and can be set by the creator, the oracle is subject to price manipulation, the creator can wait for a few block to make sure the po.period query get price data and then use the price to sweep fund from the SplitSwapper.sol

## Impact

a user can front-run the price oracle and create the token0 and token1 and po.fee and add liqudity to set the initial price. given that the newly created liquidity pool price is low and can be set by the creator, the oracle is subject to price manipulation, the creator can wait for a few block to make sure the po.period query get price data and then use the price to sweep fund from the SplitSwapper.sol

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol valid the pool exists with token0 and token1 and fee setting before using the oracle when deploying the price oracle contract, and the price deviation check can be implemented - if the price deviates too much from last query revert the transaction to avoid manipulation.
