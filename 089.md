# A malicious user can steal ETH funds from the SwapperImpl contract.

## Summary
While other users might send ETH to the ``SwapperImpl`` contract via the ``payback()`` function, a malicious user might steal funds from the contract by calling ``flash()``.

## Vulnerability Detail
We show how a malicious user can steal ETH from the  ``SwapperImpl`` contract:

1. When ``flash()`` is called, the function calls ``_transferToTrader()`` to calculate ``amountToBeneficiary``:

```javascript
 (uint256 amountToBeneficiary, uint256[] memory amountsToBeneficiary) =
            _transferToTrader(_tokenToBeneficiary, quoteParams_);
```

For simplicity, suppose we only have one element in ``quoteParams_``.  To steal funds from the contract, the caller just needs to set ``qp.quotePair.base`` to ETH and set ``qp.baseAmount`` as the balance of ETH of the contract. Then L249 will send the whole balance of ETH to the sender, the malicious user.

## Impact

## Recommendation
Keep track of the msg.value and make sure that the caller sends sufficient ETH so that stealing is impossible. Other machanisms might also be introduced to avoid such vulnerabilities.
