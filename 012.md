# Oracle overrides will not support Uniswap pools with no fee

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

When the oracle is queried for a given pair, it first checks for pair override values. If no such values exist, it falls back on the default values:
```solidity
PairOverride memory po = _getPairOverride(scqp);

...

if (po.fee == 0) {
    po.fee = $defaultFee;
}
```
While Uniswap currently does not offer pools with 0% fees, their governance is able to add new fee tiers at any time ([see their docs for details](https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/protocol/fees#pool-fees-tiers)). They recently added 0.01%, their lowest tier yet, inching towards offering a free tier.

In the event that a Uniswap pool with a 0% fee is set as an override, this check will assume no fee has been set and fall back on the default. For a pair that does not provide much liquidity for the default fee tier, this could lead to inaccuracy of the result.

0xSplits is built around long term stability (no upgrades, etc), so it seems important to create these checks such that they are evergreen.

## Impact

In the event that Uniswap rolls out a 0 fee tier, users who attempt to override with this tier will have their oracle checks silently fail and return the default tier.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The `PairOverride` struct should contain a separate boolean value for `feeSet`, which would determine whether the `fee` value should be used, rather than relying on the 0 value to mean unset:
```diff
struct PairOverride {
    uint24 fee;
+   bool feeSet
    uint32 period;
    uint32 scaledOfferFactor;
}
```

```diff
-if (po.fee == 0) {
+if (!po.feeSet) {
    po.fee = $defaultFee;
}
```
