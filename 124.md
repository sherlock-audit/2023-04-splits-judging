# Difference of decimals places between input and output tokens can lead to Swapper's balance to be drained.

## Summary
When swapping tokens with lots of decimal places to tokens with small amount of decimals, the resulting amount of tokens received may be rounded down to zero depending on the total amount of tokens being swapped and the difference between the tokens' decimals. Attackers can exploit this in some situations to drain a Swapper's balance without having to return any tokens to the beneficiary, effectively stealing from the Swapper.

## Vulnerability Detail
Swapping tokens with lots of decimals to tokens with small amount of decimals can result in rounding down in `_getQuoteAmount`, as there is no check if `amountsToBeneficiary[i] > 0`, this could lead to loss of funds to users. `_getQuoteAmount` will calculate the exchange rate based on the price data obtained from the Uniswap Oracle. However, if the tokens have different decimal places, the resulting value may be rounded down to zero depending on the total amount of tokens being swapped. For example, consider a quote of USDT (6 decimals) received from a swap of 1wei of WETH (18 decimals), `_getQuoteAmount` will return zero. Therefore attackers could `flash` to get those amount of WETH without paying anything back to the beneficiary. To make the attack more pratical, attackers can optimize the base amount of WETH that can be sent while maintaining USDT output to zero and keep calling `flash` until the Swapper contract is drained. 

As defined in the docs, consider input tokens as the tokens received by the Swapper contract and output token as the tokens received by the beneficiary after Swapper's `flash`. If a Swapper contract has as output token one token with small amount of decimals, for example USDT with 6 decimals or EURS, the euro-based stablecoin, with only 2 decimals, attacker can exploit this by calling `flash` and swapping small amounts of incoming tokens with 18 decimals, like WETH or USDC, allowing them to receive the Swapper's input token balances without having to transfer any output token back, due to rounding down. They can do this repetitively until the Swapper is fully drained of those tokens with high amount of decimals.

## Impact
Loss of funds to the Swapper contract, as some of its funds could be drained without receiving anything in return, as explained above. It is not profitable for the attacker as the gas cost would offset the profit from the small trades (at least on mainnet, if splits-swapper were to be deployed on L2 in the future, where gas fees are smaller, then this attack could be profitable). Nevertheless an dedicated attacker could afford to spend gas to drain a Swapper contract without paying anything back to the beneficiary, resulting in loss of funds to users and damaging the protocol reputation.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Please consider adding a zero check to SwapperImpl's `_transferToTrader`, preventing the callers of `flash` from receiving input tokens if `amountsToBeneficiary[i] == 0`. See diff below to the SwapperImpl.sol contract as an example remediation.
