# SappwerImpl: Malicious trader can drain out tokens because of difference in token decimals

## Summary
there is no minimum amount for tokens to swap.
swapping the minimum amount of base token can result in zero amount of quote token, especially when the decimals of quote token is less. 
So a malicious trader can call `flash()` and get some of the base tokens without sending any quote tokens 

## Vulnerability Detail
Suppose: 
* token in swapperImpl (**B**) is 18 decimals 
* tokenToBeneficiary (**Q**) is 2 decimals 
* The oracle price of swapping tokens is 0.001

1. Attacker calls `flas()` to get and swap 1 of token B and send token Q to the beneficiary
2. `transferToTrader`, transfers 1 token B to the attacker
    + amountToTrader = baseAmount = 1 token B = 1e18 (in decimals)
    + qouteAmount = price * baseAmount = 0.001 * 1 = 0.001 token Q = 0 (in decimals)
    + amountToBeneficiary = qouteAmount = 0
3. attacker does not need to return any tokens, since amountToBeneficiary is 0
    `_transferToBeneficiary(_tokenToBeneficiary, amountToBeneficiary)`
    `tokenToBeneficiary_.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, _beneficiary, amountToBeneficiary_);`
4. Attacker repeats the cycle to drain out all of token B in `swapperImpl` without paying any token

Note that since the tokenToBeneficiary (token Q) is 2 decimals, the amountToBeneficiary should be 2 decimals and can't be 18 decimals.

## Impact
A malicious trader can drain out tokens without sending anything to the beneficiary

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
revet or skip (continue) when the quoteAmount = 0
