# Use two steps owner transfer

## Summary
In [OwnableImpl.transferOwnership](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-splits/blob/main/splits-utils/src/OwnableImpl.sol#L45) it just takes one step to transfer owner to another address. If that address is invalid then the ownership is lost forever.

## Vulnerability Detail
There are two issues for [OwnableImpl.transferOwnership](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-splits/blob/main/splits-utils/src/OwnableImpl.sol#L45)
- It doesn't validate that `owner_` shouldn't be `address(0)`
- If it passes an invalid `owner_` param, it can never be rollback

## Impact
The ownership could be lost forever

## Recommendation
Use Openzepplin two steps ownership transfer: [transferOwnership](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/ownership#Ownable-transferOwnership-address-) and then the new owner [renounceOwnership](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/ownership#Ownable-renounceOwnership--)
