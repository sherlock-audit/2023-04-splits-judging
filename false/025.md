# PassThroughWalletImpl passThroughTokens function is not checking for empty input

## Summary

The passThroughTokens function in PassThroughWalletImpl.sol does not check for empty input, which could lead to unnecessary gas consumption and potential Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail

The passThroughTokens function in PassThroughWalletImpl.sol accepts an array of tokens as input but does not check if the input array is empty. If an empty array is provided, the function will still execute, consuming gas without performing any meaningful action.

## Impact

This vulnerability could lead to unnecessary gas consumption and potential DoS attacks on the contract, impacting its availability and functionality.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider implementing a check for empty input arrays in the `passThroughTokens` function to prevent unnecessary gas consumption and potential DoS attacks. This could be achieved by adding a `require` statement to ensure that the input array is not empty.
