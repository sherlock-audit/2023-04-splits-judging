# Absence Of Contract ```initialization``` For Some Inherited Contract In ```initializer``` of Calle Contract

## Summary
Should Iniatialize inherited contracts or Those contract function will behave unusual.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
contract SwapperImpl is WalletImpl, PausableImpl
```
SwapperImpl.sol contract iniherit ```WalletImpl``` and ```PausableImpl``` contracts
So technically There should be initializations for those contract should called inside ```SwapperImpl.sol``` contract which is absent here for ```WalletImpl```.

For that reason those contracts' ( WalletImpl) functions will behave unusual due to absence of contract initialization Specifically ```OwnableImpl``` part.

## Impact
Some Functions from contract ```WalletImpl.sol``` behave unusual due to absence of contract initialization.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
    function initializer(InitParams calldata params_) external { 
        // only swapperFactory may call `initializer`
        if (msg.sender != swapperFactory) revert Unauthorized();

        // don't need to init wallet separately
        __initPausable({owner_: params_.owner, paused_: params_.paused});
+     __initWallet(params_.owner)

        $beneficiary = params_.beneficiary;
        $tokenToBeneficiary = params_.tokenToBeneficiary;
        $oracle = params_.oracle;
    }
```

Recommended to initialize ```WalletImpl.sol``` inside intializer of ```SwapperImpl.sol``` contract
