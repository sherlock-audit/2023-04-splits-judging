# swapperImpl.flash() does not account for swap fees and price discrepancies between the oracle and swapper.

## Summary
In the swapperImpl contract, a trader must pay an additional amount for the swap fee. Therefore, the price the trader gets will always be higher than the oracle price.
To successfully call the `flash()` function, the trader must keep an additional amount of tokenToBeneficiary (beyond the amountToBeneficiary) in their own address to account for this price difference.

## Vulnerability Detail
The swapperImpl contract allows traders to call the `flash()` function to withdraw tokens in return for sending tokenToBeneficiary to the beneficiary.
However, traders have to pay a swap fee (0.3% on Uniswap) so the price they get is lower than the Oracle price. 
This means the amount of tokens the trader receives is less than the amount calculated by the `flash()` function. 
Therefore, traders have no incentive to call `flash()` unless they own the `diversifier`. 
For a successful flash transaction, the owner of the diversifier should keep an extra amount (0.3%) of tokenToBeneficiay.


## Impact
flash() is not cost-efficient for traders and the owner should always keep tokenToBeneficiary to be able to flash to swapperImpl

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Increase the value of amountToBeneficiary to account for the swap fee and provide an incentive for third-party traders to invoke the flash() function. The increment can be a variable, adjustable by the owner, to guarantee it encompasses the swap fee and offers an appealing incentive for traders.
