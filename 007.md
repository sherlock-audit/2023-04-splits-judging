# PassThroughWalletImpl's setPassThrough() function can accept address(0x0) could cause loss of funds

## Summary
PassThroughWalletImpl  contract has a function to manage the passthrough address, managable by the owner. The set function can be called by owner. The set function does not validate of address(0x0).

Since this is managed by the owner and can be corrected, it is marked as medium

## Vulnerability Detail
If the owner by mistake sets the passthrough address to address(0x0). Although he has the ability to recover by setting it back to the correct value. But the risk is around the passThroughTokens() function where tokens are routed via this function, will be transfer from Wallet to address(0x0) and will be permanently lost.

## Impact
Loss of funds as they could be routed to address(0x0) 

## Code Snippet

function passThroughTokens(address[] calldata tokens_) external pausable returns (uint256[] memory amounts) {
        address _passThrough = $passThrough;
        uint256 length = tokens_.length;
        amounts = new uint256[](length);
        for (uint256 i; i < length;) {
            address token = tokens_[i];
            uint256 amount = token._balanceOf(address(this));
            amounts[i] = amount;
            **token._safeTransfer(_passThrough, amount);**

            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }

        emit PassThrough(tokens_, amounts);
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check for the address passed to setPassThrough() to be a valid not, specifically, not address(0x0)
