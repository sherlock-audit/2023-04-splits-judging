# UniV3OracleImpl doesn't have ability to pause swapping specific token

## Summary
UniV3OracleImpl doesn't have ability to pause swapping specific token
## Vulnerability Detail
When a pair is added to `UniV3OracleImpl` contract, then [it's saved to `$_pairOverrides`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-splits/blob/main/splits-oracle/src/UniV3OracleImpl.sol#L240) variable. This variable contains information about swapping one currency to another. Later this information is queried by `SwapperImpl` contract in order to receive quote amount. In case if no inforamtion were stored to the `$_pairOverrides`, then default fee, period and discount are set. In case if uniswap [has such pool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-splits/blob/main/splits-oracle/src/UniV3OracleImpl.sol#L269-L272), then trade is possible, even if `$_pairOverrides` doesn't contain information.

The problem is that currently owner of oracle doesn't have ability to disallow swapping of specific token/pair. Because of that user can't control some situations.
For example `SwapperImpl` have a lot of usdc and it's price has decreased. So anyone is interested to swap it for a good price. But `SwapperImpl` owner believes that this is temporal issue and the price will be better in some time, so he doesn't want to loose much on such trade. And he decides to temporarily freeze usdc swapping, but he can't as UniV3OracleImpl doesn't provide such ability and trade is possible when pool exists.
## Impact
UniV3OracleImpl owner doesn't have ability to pause swapping specific token which can cost money for him
