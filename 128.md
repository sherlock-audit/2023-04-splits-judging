# SwapperFactory is suspicious of the reorg attack

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The createSwapper function deploys a SwapperImpl  contract using the create, where the address derivation depends only on the SwapperFactory nonce.
Some of the chains (Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum) to which the SwapperFactory will be deployed are suspicious of the reorg attack.

Here you may be convinced that the Polygon has in practice subject to reorgs. Even more, the reorg on the picture is 1.5 minutes long. So, it is quite enough to create the  SwapperImpl and transfer funds to that address, especially when someone uses a script, and not doing it by hand.

Optimistic rollups (Optimism/Arbitrum) are also suspect to reorgs since if someone finds a fraud the blocks will be reverted, even though the user receives a confirmation and already created a split.

## Impact
If users rely on the address derivation in advance or try to deploy the SwapperImpl with the same address on different EVM chains, any funds sent to the split could potentially be withdrawn by anyone else. All in all, it could lead to the theft of user funds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Deploy the SwapperImpl contract via create2 with salt and msg.sender instead create.
