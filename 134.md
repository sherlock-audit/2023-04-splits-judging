# Funds can be stucked in the system or stolen by callers due to payable `flash` function

## Summary
Caller is not intended to send the eth via the flash function, if sent the user funds can be stuck or worse stolen by any caller to the `flash` function. 
## Vulnerability Detail
`flash` is not meant to receive any ether as the system intends to use the `payback` function to receive the ether via callback, so any funds that are sent via payable `flash` function would be either stuck in the contract or stolen by another caller.

Lets discuss the following scnerio:
Suppose the user sends eth with `flash` function, swapping happens and now the contract is empty, so now the funds cannot be extracted until some more funds are sent to the contract or even worse, if the benificiary token is not set to eth the funds are stuck forever and cannot be extracted cause we will always get into the else condition here:

Suppose the swapper owner tries to help him and change the token to eth, now another bot may front run him and take away all of his eth too.

In comments it is made aware to not to call `payback` without callback, but user is never made of above condition.
## Impact
User funds are stuck or stolen.

## Recommendation
Remove the payable from `flash`
