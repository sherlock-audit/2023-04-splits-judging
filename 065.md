# OwnableImpl() lacks some sanity check and a two-step procedure to change ownership.

## Summary
OwnableImpl() lacks some sanity check and a two-step procedure to change ownership.

## Vulnerability Detail
``OwnableImpl`` is an abstract contract that allows an admin to manage  the ownership of a contract including setting ownership and the transfer of ownership. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-splits/blob/main/splits-utils/src/OwnableImpl.sol#L7-L57](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-splits/blob/main/splits-utils/src/OwnableImpl.sol#L7-L57)

However, it has two issues: 

1) lack of zero address check for ``owner_`` for the following two functions, ``__initOwnable()`` and ``transferOwnership()``. If a zero address is entered by mistake or on purpose for ``owner_``, then the ownership is lost forever. 

2) The ``transferOwnership()`` uses a one-step procedure to change ownership. This might be dangerous, if an invalid address is entered, either by mistake or by a compromised owner, then the ownership is lost forever. Current practice uses a two-step procedure to change ownership, using a ``pendingOwner`` as a proposed new owner, and then only the ``pendingOwner`` can accept the owernership. 

## Impact
Due to lack of these checks, the ownership of a contract might be lost forever.
