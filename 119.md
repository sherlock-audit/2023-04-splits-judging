# An attacker can reenter `flash`  by using the `ISwapperFlashCallback` callback

## Summary
After the attacker gets erc20 tokens from the swapper they can reenter `flash` and get more erc20 tokens
## Vulnerability Detail
Since the `flash` callback is called by `msg.sender`
since `_transferToTrader` gives the caller erc20/eth  and then  the callback is called.So the caller will get more tokens than spent.
ex:
Beneficiary = bob 
Alice = attacker
100 usdc and 100 dai and swapper:dai
the user provides 100 dai and  they should get back 100 usdc
but since of the malicious callback, the user doesn't have to provide any amount of tokens for swapping to dai.

Alice is a  smart contract that reenters at the end, when all the funds are gone and the last reenter supplies `0` params, they should end the tx with all the funds in the contract and no loss.
## Impact
be `Beneficiary` loses their funds

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-splits/blob/main/splits-swapper/src/SwapperImpl.sol#L208-L215

```solidity
 address _tokenToBeneficiary = $tokenToBeneficiary;
        (uint256 amountToBeneficiary, uint256[] memory amountsToBeneficiary) =
            _transferToTrader(_tokenToBeneficiary, quoteParams_);

        ISwapperFlashCallback(msg.sender).swapperFlashCallback({
            tokenToBeneficiary: _tokenToBeneficiary,
            amountToBeneficiary: amountToBeneficiary,
            data: callbackData_
        });
```

```solidity

            if (amountToTrader > tokenToTrader._balanceOf(address(this))) {
                revert InsufficientFunds_InContract();
            }

            amountToBeneficiary += amountsToBeneficiary[i];
            tokenToTrader._safeTransfer(msg.sender, amountToTrader);

            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
