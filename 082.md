# The `flash` function has improper data validation

## Summary
It is possible to pass empty `quoteParams_` and execute successful transaction (if the transaction is not successful, the reverted transaction is unnecessarily costlier).

## Vulnerability Detail
The `flash` function is called with empty `quoteParams_`. The `_transferToTrader` is called and then oracle's `getQuoteAmounts`. This function is returned because it will not enter for cycle.

```solidity
    function getQuoteAmounts(QuoteParams[] calldata quoteParams_)
        external
        view
        override
        pausable
        returns (uint256[] memory quoteAmounts)
    {
        uint256 length = quoteParams_.length;
        quoteAmounts = new uint256[](length);
        for (uint256 i; i < length;) {
            quoteAmounts[i] = _getQuoteAmount(quoteParams_[i]);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }
```

Execution continues, and passes:

```solidity
        if (amountsToBeneficiary.length != length) revert Invalid_AmountsToBeneficiary();
```

because `0 == 0` and skips the for cycle and returns default values for the return values (zeroes). Then `swapperFlashCallback` is called - out of scope and then `_transferToBeneficiary(_tokenToBeneficiary, amountToBeneficiary)` where `_tokenToBeneficiary` is set by contract and `amountToBeneficiary` is zero. There it depends on `_tokenToBeneficiary`, but if `tokenToBeneficiary_._isETH()` is true, the transaction is successful without revert and it do not nothing.

## Impact
Undefined/unwanted behavior.

## Tool used
Manual Review
Testing framework - the system wasn't fully mocked (because lack of time) so I have decided to comment out the out of scope function `swapperFlashCallback` and then I was able to reproduce it with a following sequence:

- deploy mock token, oracle (with zero addresses), swapper
- swapper.initializer([owner address, false, beneficiary address, some token address, oracle address])
- swapper.flash(empty, empty)

## Recommendation
Add a proper validation (check against empty params in all public entrypoints) to prevent undesired executions.
