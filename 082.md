# swapper isn't approved to transfer `amountToBeneficiary` in SwapperImpl.sol

## Summary
swapper isn't approved to transfer `amountToBeneficiary`

## Vulnerability Detail
when `tokenToBeneficiary` is an ERC20 token, the swapper needs to be approved to transfer `amountToBeneficiary` 
But here `approve` isn't done first before the contract attempts to carryout the transfer although `safeTransferFrom` is used.
```solidity
        } else {
            tokenToBeneficiary_.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, _beneficiary, amountToBeneficiary_);
```
## Impact
The `msg.sender` doesn't approve the contract to transfer `amounToBeneficiary` therefore the transfer will fail.

## Recommendation
If `tokenToBeneficiary` is an ERC20, you must use `approve` Swapper to transfer amountToBeneficiary.
