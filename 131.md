# Using TWAP oracle prices can be a cause of money losing during high volatility periods

## Summary
TWAP doesn't provide the current spot price and has a gap, which depends on the market volatility. Giving the opportunity to exchange the `$tokenToBeneficiary` token on other tokens in the `SwapperImpl` contract with TWAP price is like giving a time machine. When the `$tokenToBeneficiary` price goes down, the TWAP price is higher than the spot price. In this case exchanging at the TWAP price is pointless. The time to exchange comes when the spot price becomes higher than the TWAP price. It will be exactly at the market local bottom.
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-splits/blob/main/splits-oracle/src/UniV3OracleImpl.sol#L248-L285
The `_getQuoteAmount` returns the quote amount for the trade calculated with TWAP oracle price with possible [`scaledOfferFactor`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-splits/blob/main/splits-oracle/src/UniV3OracleImpl.sol#L284). Economically meaningless buying at TWAP price which higher than spot price. The `scaledOfferFactor` can speed up the deal, but will not allow to sell `$tokenToBeneficiary` at the market price. The more volatile the market, the higher the discount should be.  Since there is no mechanism to automatically change the `$tokenToBeneficiary`, there will come a point where the beneficiary will not be able to control the demand.
## Impact
The `$tokenToBeneficiary` token is always exchanged at its worst price. The more volatile the market, the greater the effect.

## Recommendation
I suggest using TWAP price with a short period to be closer to the spot price, but also comparing it with long period TWAP price to prevent oracle price manipulation.
