# Swapper as an attack vector for taking ERC20 from flash trader accounts

## Summary
Using the `WalletImpl.execCalls()` function, an attacker can drain ERC20 tokens from the account of a flash trader contract.
The attacker can target any trader contract.
The attacker can specify any ERC20 that the trader contract holds and can obtain the entire balance.

## Vulnerability Detail
Any attacker EOA can perform the following exploitation steps:
1. Attacker creates a `SwapperImpl` contract via `SwapperFactory.createSwapper()`, supplying `CreateSwapperParams` that specifies themself as the owner.
2. Attacker identifies a victim contract that inherits `ISwapperFlashCallback` and holds a balance of an ERC20 token.
3. Attacker calls `WalletImpl.execCalls()` in the their own Swapper contract, supplying ...
- the victim contract's address and the function signature for `swapperFlashCallback()`. That will survive the victim's use of `SwapperCallbackValidation.verifyCallback()` since `msg.sender` is a Factory-created Swapper.
- fabricated data about a supposed `flash()` execution in progress. This leads the victim to approve the attacker for the specified ERC20 token amount, as would be required for a legitimate `flash()` Tx to complete.
4. Attacker transfers the ERC20 tokens from the trader with the approval given.

## Impact
While this does not risk loss of funds from a Splits-based wallet, it is a serious issue because it results in loss of funds from traders who are indispensable to the Diversifier system.
It would pose a reputational risk for the protocol to, on the one hand, provide the `SwapperCallbackValidation.verifyCallback()` function for traders and advise they use it in their `swapperFlashCallback()` but, on the other hand, advise that it isn't sufficient to validate that the call is truly from a `SwapperImpl.flash()` function.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The WalletImpl.execCalls() function should restrict calls to only functions within the same contract.
E.g. `address to;` could be removed from the `struct Call` and the following line modified
https://github.com/0xSplits/splits-utils/blob/5cefb600c387c987dfe47de94d2ded2cd6b9d824/src/WalletImpl.sol#L56
from
```solidity
            (success, returnData[i]) = calli.to.call{value: calli.value}(calli.data);
```
to
```solidity
            (success, returnData[i]) = address(this).call{value: calli.value}(calli.data); 
```

(While trader contracts could add a nonce or other information in the callback data that would make exploitation more difficult, those hurdles could be overcome by analyzing the trader's code and/or flash transactions. It is better to address the root of the issue: ability for an attacker to act as a `SwapperImpl`.)
