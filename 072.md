# SwapperImpl.sol won't be able to receive eth as the receive() function is commented out.

## Summary
SwapperImpl.sol won't be able to receive eth as the receive() function is commented out.

## Vulnerability Detail
The receive() function is commented out so basically it doesn't currently exist in SwapperImpl.sol.

## Impact
SwapperImpl.sol's logic has in mind to have eth deposited in it. I said so because in certain function the balance of eth held by the contract is checked via `balanceOf(address(this))`.

But eth can't be deposited currently because the `receive() function` was commented out.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
remove `/* */` from the `receive()` function to make it available for the contract to use.
