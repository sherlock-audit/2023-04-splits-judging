# Beneficiary would get unfair of quote amount if the converted tokens are equal

## Summary
In `flash` function after the trader transfer and swapperFlashCallback is done, an  `amountToBeneficiary` is sent to Beneficiary address by `_transferToBeneficiary` function which is calling getQuoteAmounts to transfer it to Beneficiary address on [L231](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-splits/blob/main/splits-swapper/src/SwapperImpl.sol#L231)
```solidity
amountsToBeneficiary = $oracle.getQuoteAmounts(quoteParams_);
```

Now an internal call must happens inside `getQuoteAmounts` function which is  the function `_getQuoteAmount` and here inside this function the issue occurs. (explained in Vulnerability Detail)

## Vulnerability Detail
On _getQuoteAmount function there is a skip for oracle price if the converted tokens are equal. that leaves us with a default sense that no need to get the price since they are the same which looks logical from the first sight, but Unfortunately it is not.
Lets check the code carefully on [L258](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-splits/blob/main/splits-oracle/src/UniV3OracleImpl.sol#L258-L260)
```solidity
if (cqp.cBase == cqp.cQuote) {
            return quoteParams_.baseAmount * po.scaledOfferFactor / PERCENTAGE_SCALE;
        }
```
you can see the formula here is relaying on **scaledOfferFactor** 

Now in case `po.scaledOfferFactor` is 99% the issue can happen, lets assume the beneficiary token USDC: A trader can propose a quote with 100000 USDC but the Beneficiary gets 99000 USDC.

baseAmount = 100000 USDC
scaledOfferFactor = 99% = 99_00_00 
PERCENTAGE_SCALE = 100% = 100_00_00
100000 * 990000 / 1000000 = 99000 USDC

Note: A bad actor might repeat or make this action with large amounts for the current and future funds at the swapper contract.


## Impact
Unfairness of quote amount value that Beneficiary will get if the base token equal the quote token.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Disallow swapping/trading when the base token equal the quote token.
