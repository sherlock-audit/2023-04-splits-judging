# WalletImpl cannot receive NFTs as intended

## Summary

WalletImpl is intended to turn pass through wallets into generalizable wallets that can be used for any purpose, including receiving NFTs. However, because it does not implement the `onERC721Received()` and `onERC1155Received()` functions, it will not pass the checks for `safeTransferFrom()` and will not be able to be used for NFTs as intended.

## Vulnerability Detail

`WalletImpl.sol` is inherited by `PassThroughWalletImpl.sol` and `SwapperImpl.sol` to turn them into generalizable smart contract wallets. It implements an `execCalls()` function that allows the owner to perform any arbitrary action on behalf of the contract.

The purpose of this was explained by Will in the contest Discord channel: 

> we wanted it to have the full flexibility of a smart contract wallet for various situations which might arise when using it as a pay to address (eg if you use an address for primary proceeds on artblocks it also must be able to receive & handle NFTS)

However, as it is currently implemented thee contracts will not be able to receive NFTs sent with `safeTransferFrom()`, because they do not implement the necessary functions to safely receive these tokens..

While in many cases such a situation would be Medium severity, looking at Will's example above makes clear that the circumstances in which these wallets will be used could lead to more serious consequences. For example, having a wallet that is entitled to high value NFTs but is not able to receive them is clearly a loss of funds risk, and a High severity issue.

## Impact

Any time an ERC721 or ERC1155 is attempted to be transferred with `safeTransferFrom()` or minted with `safeMint()`, the call will fail.

## Recommendation

Include `onERC721Received()` and `onERC1155Received()` functions in `WalletImpl.sol`.
