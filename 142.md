# Swapper owners ability to configure `_pairOverrides` anytime allows him to steal traders fund.

## Summary
Trader's `flash()` transaction can be frontrunned by malicious swapper owner using `setPairOverrides()`. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Swapper owner can keep track of mempool and calls `setPairOverrides` before trader's `flash()` transaction is accepted. 
Owner particularly changes one variable of the `PairOverride` struct - `scaledOfferFactor` 
```solidity
    struct PairOverride {
        uint24 fee;
        uint32 period;
        uint32 scaledOfferFactor;
    }
```
This `scaledOfferFactor` is multiplied `with actual return amount in _getQuoteAmount()` before returning. Thus, owner can inflate this variable which ultimately gets transferred from the trader to the swapper contract. 
```solidity
  return unscaledAmountToBeneficiary * po.scaledOfferFactor / PERCENTAGE_SCALE;
```
```solidity
        address _tokenToBeneficiary = $tokenToBeneficiary;
        (uint256 amountToBeneficiary, uint256[] memory amountsToBeneficiary) =
            _transferToTrader(_tokenToBeneficiary, quoteParams_); => @audit-issue - amountToBeneficiary here comes inflated.  

        ISwapperFlashCallback(msg.sender).swapperFlashCallback({
            tokenToBeneficiary: _tokenToBeneficiary,
            amountToBeneficiary: amountToBeneficiary,
            data: callbackData_
        });

        uint256 excessToBeneficiary = _transferToBeneficiary(_tokenToBeneficiary, amountToBeneficiary); ==> @audit-issue - Inflated amountToBeneficiary is passed
```

## Impact
Loss of traders funds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- There should be some upper limit for `PairOverrides` variables.
