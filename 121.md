# All factories are vulnerable to reorg attacks

## Summary
All factories, including `SwapperFactory`, `UniV3OracleFactory`, and `PassThroughWalletFactory`, are susceptible to reorg attacks that could result in users losing funds sent to newly created contracts with these factories.

## Vulnerability Detail
Chain reorganization (reorg) occurs when two blocks are published simultaneously. Short one- and two-block reorgs are common due to network latency, but longer reorgs can lead to malicious attacks. In certain EVM chains like Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum, chain reorgs occur more frequently, occasionally reaching **five minutes**, as evidenced in Polygon on February 22, 2023:

These chain reorg scenarios can cause users to lose funds sent to new addresses created by the affected factories.

All three factories use the `create` opcode to clone the original implementations. This derives the new implementation address based on the factory nonce. If a contract is created with these factories and the block is discarded minutes later, an attacker can call the same function to obtain the address that will receive the funds.

Here are potential reorg attack scenarios for each factory:

**SwapperFactory:** Bob deploys a new swapper contract using `SwapperFactory` and then sends funds to it. Alice notices a block reorg, calls `createSwapper` with herself as the owner, and her transaction is executed before Bob's. Consequently, Alice gets the address that will receive Bob's funds.

**UniV3OracleFactory:** Bob deploys a new `UniV3OracleImpl` using `UniV3OracleFactory` and then sets that oracle to an existing swapper contract. Alice detects a block reorg, calls `createOracle` with herself as the owner, and sets `$defaultScaledOfferFactor` to zero. Alice then can call `flash` on the swapper and steal all the funds.

**PassThroughWalletFactory:** Bob deploys a new `PassThroughWalletImpl` using `PassThroughWalletFactory` and then sends funds to it. Alice notices a block reorg, calls `createPassThroughWallet` with herself as the owner and `$passThrough`, and her transaction is executed before Bob's. Alice obtains the address and the funds sent to it.

## Impact
During a block reorg, if a transaction involving any of the aforementioned factories is in the affected blocks, a malicious user can execute a transaction in place of the original one, gaining the address and possibly acquiring the funds that will later be sent to it.

## Code Snippet
The three factories use the `clone` function, that uses the `create` opcode to deploy the new implementation contracts.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
For all three factories, use the `create2` function to deploy implementation contracts, incorporating `msg.sender` and the `InitParams` as the salt. This method ensures that the implementation address is derived not only from the factory nonce, effectively mitigating the reorg attack.
