# `SwapperImpl.flash` can be frontrun which causes swapper lose tokens

## Summary
When `tokenToBeneficiary_` is ETH, and a user calls `payback` first and then `flash`, the `flash` could be frontrun by another malicious user.

## Vulnerability Detail
When `tokenToBeneficiary_` is ETH, a user needs to call `SwapperImpl` twice to do swap, 
1. Call [payback](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-splits/blob/main/splits-swapper/src/SwapperImpl.sol#L197) to send ETH into the contract
2. Call [flash](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-splits/blob/main/splits-swapper/src/SwapperImpl.sol#L203)

In `flash`, it will call [_transferToBeneficiary](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-splits/blob/main/splits-swapper/src/SwapperImpl.sol#L218), and  `_transferToBeneficiary` will [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-splits/blob/main/splits-swapper/src/SwapperImpl.sol#L263-L265) if `$_payback` is less than `amountToBeneficiary_`, if yes then the tx will revert. So when amountToBeneficiary_ is ETH, it requires the user has deposited enough ETH into the contract.

However a frontrun could happen just after user calls `payback` and before he calls `flash`, a malicious user could frontrun `flash` and in such case the swapped token will be [sent to the malicious user](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-splits/blob/main/splits-swapper/src/SwapperImpl.sol#L249).

## Impact
The user who initiates swap won't receive swapped tokens

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Merge `payback` and `flash` into one function, since `flash` is already a `payable` function
