# Beneficiary will receive less tokenToBeneficiary when it recieves profit in the form of tokenToBeneficiary tokens.

## Summary

Swapper contract incentivize flash swappers to exchange `tokenToBeneficiary` tokens for any other token sent to the swapper contract by giving them a discount. With this, the swapper contract expects that any token sent to it as form of "profit" (just one example), will get exchanged with `tokenToBeneficiary`.

## Vulnerability Detail

On the oracle implementation during the `_getQuoteAmount` function we have the following code: 

```solidity
if (cqp.cBase == cqp.cQuote) {
   return quoteParams_.baseAmount * po.scaledOfferFactor / PERCENTAGE_SCALE;
}
```

If the `base` is equal to `quote` it returns a price applying the discount set through `scaledOfferFactor`, the oracle is saying that you can exchange the same token but with a discount. For example flash swapper can receive `1 ether` and send `0.9 ether` (10% discount) to the swapper contract.

This can be exploited when the swapper contract receives `tokenToBeneficiary`.

Timeline:

Lets say that `tokenToBeneficiary` is ether, and that discount is 10%.

1.- Swapper contract receives 1 ether.
2.- Flash swapper can use a quotePair of `base == ether` and `quote == ether` and the oracle will allow him to get the 1 ether balance from the swapper contract, and only to send 0.9 ether.
3.- Swapper contract only sends 0.9 ether to the beneficiary.

## Impact

Beneficiary wont get the 100% of `tokenToBeneficiary` sent to it when it should because it does not need the services of flash swappers since the profit sent to it is already in the token wanted.

From the docs, flash swappers are sophisticated so they can watch a tx that is about to send `tokenToBeneficiary` tokens to swapper and backrun it.

## Recommendation

Change this:

```solidity
if (cqp.cBase == cqp.cQuote) {
   return quoteParams_.baseAmount * po.scaledOfferFactor / PERCENTAGE_SCALE;
}
```
for this:

```solidity
if (cqp.cBase == cqp.cQuote) {
   revert();
}
```
