# CreateSwapper accepts address(0x0) as owner

## Summary
SwapperFactory.createSwapper() function accepts address(0x0) as owner. After the owner is set as address(0x0), the ability to manage the swapper will be lost.

## Vulnerability Detail
After the address(0x) is set as owner, the managing features for the swapper are lost in SwapperImpl contract.

## Impact
With address(0x0) set as owner, the below functions are not accessible any more due to owner check.

a) setBeneficiary
b) setTokenToBeneficiary
c) setOracle

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
check in OwnableImpl.__initOwnable() where before setting, it should checks for incoming value to be a valid one before setting the owner in the storage. The function should revert incase address(0x0) was passed as owner
