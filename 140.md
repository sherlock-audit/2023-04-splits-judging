# All the tokens can never be swapped and leads to unexpected reverts and missed reward for caller.

## Summary
Caller cannot swap the exact amounts, for example if swapper have 10 DAI and beneficiary token is OP, so if caller have enough token to get all 10 DAI the swap cannot happen.
## Vulnerability Detail
1. Suppose BOB is caller and alice is the benificary.
2. Beneficiary token is OP, Swapper have the 10 Dai token and bob have enough tokens to get all the dai.
3. Bob calls the flash, but the transaction reverts.
The reason bob cannot get the 10 DAI is because in actual bob reward is 10 DAI + scaling factor and balance of contract is only 10DAI.

If user decides to swap less, there is missed reward for caller but excess funds are flushed anyways.
## Impact
Unexpected reverts and missed reward for the caller.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use some different approach for reward mechanism where the caller may not feel betrayed of his fair share from the system.
