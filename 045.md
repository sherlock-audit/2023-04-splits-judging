# PassThroughWalletImpl lack default payable keywords to handle the native ETH

## Summary

PassThroughWalletImpl lack default payable keywords to handle the native ETH

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation, PassThroughWalletImpl lack default payable keywords to handle the native ETH

```solidity
/// send tokens_ to $passThrough
function passThroughTokens(address[] calldata tokens_) external pausable returns (uint256[] memory amounts) {
	address _passThrough = $passThrough;
	uint256 length = tokens_.length;
	amounts = new uint256[](length);
	for (uint256 i; i < length;) {
		address token = tokens_[i];
		uint256 amount = token._balanceOf(address(this));
		amounts[i] = amount;
		token._safeTransfer(_passThrough, amount);

		unchecked {
			++i;
		}
	}

	emit PassThrough(tokens_, amounts);
}
```

this basically mean that only ERC20 is compatible with PassThroughWalletImpl and the pass through receiver canno receive ETH properly.

## Impact

the PassThroughWallet cannot receive ETH and pasThroughToken cannot send ETH out.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol uncomment the receive() external payable in PassThroughWalletImpl
