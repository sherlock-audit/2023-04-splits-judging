# Reentrancy Vulnerability in WalletImpl.sol#execCalls Function

## Summary
The execCalls function allows the contract owner to execute arbitrary calls without any re-entrancy guard. This lack of protection makes the contract vulnerable to re-entrancy attacks, potentially causing unexpected behavior or loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
The execCalls function iterates through an array of calls and executes them one by one. Since it doesn't employ any re-entrancy protection, a malicious actor could exploit this vulnerability by calling back into the execCalls function before the current call execution finishes. This could lead to undesirable side effects, such as draining the contract's balance or manipulating its state.

## Impact
A successful re-entrancy attack could lead to the loss of funds, unauthorized state changes, or other unintended consequences

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate the re-entrancy vulnerability, implement the provided nonReentrantGuard modifier and use it in the execCalls function. The modifier ensures that the function cannot be called recursively by setting the _notEntered flag before and after the function execution. Here's the implementation of the recommended nonReentrantGuard modifier:

```solidity
bool private _notEntered;

modifier nonReentrantGuard() {
    require(!_notEntered, "ReentrancyGuard: reentrant call");
    _notEntered = true;
    _;
    _notEntered = false;
}
```
To apply the nonReentrantGuard modifier, simply add it to the execCalls function:

```solidity
function execCalls(Call[] calldata calls_)
    external
    payable
    onlyOwner
    nonReentrantGuard // Add this modifier
    returns (uint256 blockNumber, bytes[] memory returnData)
{
    // Function implementation
}
```
