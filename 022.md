# Missing access control in PassThroughWalletImpl initializer function

## Summary

The initializer function in the PassThroughWalletImpl contract is missing access control, allowing any address to call the function and potentially overwrite the owner, pass-through address, and paused state.

## Vulnerability Detail

The initializer function in PassThroughWalletImpl.sol is used to set the initial values of the contract, such as the owner, paused state, and pass-through address. Currently, the function only checks if the caller is the PassThroughWalletFactory. However, due to the lack of access control, an attacker could potentially call the function and overwrite the contract's state.

## Impact

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized control over the pass-through wallet, potentially leading to unauthorized token transfers and other malicious actions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider implementing a mechanism to ensure that the initializer function can only be called once or by an authorized address. This could be achieved by using an initialized state variable that is checked and set in the function or by restricting the function to only be called by a specific authorized address.
