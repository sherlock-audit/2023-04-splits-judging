# setTokenToBeneficiary() fails to send existing ETH In the contract to the beneficiary when it changes $tokenToBeneficiary from ETH to another token.

## Summary
``setTokenToBeneficiary()`` fails to send existing ETH In the contract to the beneficiant when it changes ``$tokenToBeneficiary`` from ETH to another token.

## Vulnerability Detail
``setTokenToBeneficiary()`` allows the owner to change ``$tokenToBeneficiary`` from one token to another, for example,  from ETH to another token. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-splits/blob/main/splits-swapper/src/SwapperImpl.sol#L157-L160](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-splits/blob/main/splits-swapper/src/SwapperImpl.sol#L157-L160)

However, when it changes ``$tokenToBeneficiary`` from ETH to another token, the tokens that sent by ``payback()`` cannot be sent to the beneficiary anymore. This is so because ``flash()`` can only send  ```$tokenToBeneficiary``  to the beneficiary. 

## Impact
 when it changes ``$tokenToBeneficiary`` from ETH to another token, the tokens that sent by ``payback()`` cannot be sent to the beneficiary anymore.  They will be stuck in the contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Send the ETH to the beneficiary when changing  `$tokenToBeneficiary`` from ETH to another token. 
```diff
function setTokenToBeneficiary(address tokenToBeneficiary_) external onlyOwner {
+      if($tokenToBeneficiary_._isETH() && tokenToBeneficiary != $tokenToBeneficiary_)
+                           $_payback = 0;
+                           _beneficiary.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
+      }

        $tokenToBeneficiary = tokenToBeneficiary_;
        emit SetTokenToBeneficiary(tokenToBeneficiary_);
    }
```
