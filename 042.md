# Overflow error

## Summary
The `payback()` function takes the value of the incoming payment (in msg.value) and converts it to a uint96 (an unsigned 96-bit integer) using the toUint96() method. The converted value is then added to an internal variable called $_payback.if the payback function is called multiple times and the values sent in each call are added to the $_payback variable without checking for overflow.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is a potential security issue with below code related to integer overflow. In Solidity, uint96 is an unsigned integer type that can hold values from 0 to 2^96-1, which is a very large number. However, if the payback function is called multiple times and the values sent in each call are added to the $_payback variable without checking for overflow, the variable may eventually exceed its maximum value . This can lead to  unexpected behavior in the contract. To prevent this, it is important to check the value of $_payback before adding any new values and to take appropriate measures to avoid integer overflow.

```solidity
uint96 internal $_payback;

    function payback() external payable {
        $_payback += msg.value.toUint96();
        emit Payback(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }

```
