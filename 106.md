# payback() fails to check that $tokenToBeneficiary == ETH, as a result, ETH collected by payback() will not be sent to the beneficiary and lost in the contract.

## Summary
payback() fails to check that ``$tokenToBeneficiary == ETH``, as a result, ETH collected by payback() will not be sent to the beneficiary.

## Vulnerability Detail

`` payback()`` allows a user to send ETH to a swapper and then a call of flash() will send such ETH to a beneficiary

However, flash() will only send $tokenToBeneficiary to the beneficiary.  That means, if  ``$tokenToBeneficiary  != ETH``, then the ETH collected by ``payback()`` will not be sent to the beneficiary at all! We should not have collected ETH via ``payback()`` in the first place.

## Recommendation
Check and make sure ``$tokenToBeneficiary == ETH``:

```diff
 function payback() external payable {
+     require(tokenToBeneficiary_._isETH());

        $_payback += msg.value.toUint96();
        emit Payback(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }
```
