# The default configuration for the oralce shouldnt be used

## Summary
Because the default configuration is a 30-minute twap  it shouldn't be used its to slow 
## Vulnerability Detail
For tokens like ETH where the price can  move  rapidly, a 30-minute twap can give an old price, and attackers can steal funds 
## Impact
too old twap on rapid price movement tokens will cause loss of funds 
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-splits/blob/main/splits-oracle/src/UniV3OracleImpl.sol#L275
```solidity
(int24 arithmeticMeanTick,) = OracleLibrary.consult({pool: pool, secondsAgo: po.period});
```
The reason why it's not an owner misconfig is that the protocol itself will use this config so that's why its  not an owners/misconfig issue.
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
make it not the default  config and have more verifications and make it smaller then 30 minutes
