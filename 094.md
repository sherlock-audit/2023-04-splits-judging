# RETRACTED - Loss of funds sent to payback() in base contract

## Summary
The base `SwapperImpl` contract instance can receive ETH via `payback()` resulting in loss of funds. 

## Vulnerability Detail
[The payable `payback()` function](https://github.com/0xSplits/splits-swapper/blob/6b64cdbba099050c16a02e997a5ae263a2d7dacc/src/SwapperImpl.sol#L197) that can receive ETH during a flash trade in every clone of `SwapperImpl` can also be called and provided ETH in the base (non-clone) contract instance. 

The `SwapperImpl` source does not have a `receive()` function, (and instead it is injected during cloning). This is presumably because having a `receive()` in the base contract poses a risk of funds being locked in it. However, the `payback()` function and poses the same risk.

## Impact
ETH sent to the base `SwapperImpl` instance is locked since there is no withdrawal mechanism. It is not possible to retrieve via `flash()` because the base `SwapperImpl` is not initialized, so its oracle address is 0 ... as is the owner address, preventing any change in configuration that might allow `flash()` to succeed.

While this would be an accident scenario since there's no valid reason for interacting with the base contract, it still presents a path for loss of funds by a trader exploring the system.

## Recommendation
`payback()` should revert if `address(this) == SwapperFactory.swapperImpl`
