# Lack of access control in createOracle function of IOracleFactory.sol

## Summary

The createOracle function in the IOracleFactory.sol contract does not have any access control mechanisms, which may allow unauthorized users to create oracles, leading to potential security risks.

## Vulnerability Detail

The createOracle function in the IOracleFactory.sol contract creates a new OracleImpl instance. However, there are no access control mechanisms to restrict who can call this function, which may allow unauthorized users to create oracles with potentially malicious parameters.

## Impact

This vulnerability could allow unauthorized users to create oracles with potentially malicious parameters, leading to potential security risks such as price manipulation or misuse of the oracle infrastructure.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider implementing access control mechanisms, such as the onlyOwner or onlyAuthorized modifiers, to restrict who can call the createOracle function. This will help prevent unauthorized users from creating oracles and mitigate potential security risks.
