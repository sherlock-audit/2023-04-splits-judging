# [M-1]Two Step Transfer

## Summary
consider implementing a Two-Step Transfer pattern when changing owner

## Vulnerability Detail
Completing ownership transfer with only one step means that if the current owner of the contract accidentally executes this function, it may transfer ownership to the wrong address. Therefore, in practical applications, the "two-step principle" should be used for safer ownership transfer

## Impact
May lose ownership if wrong address is provided

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
implementing a Two-Step Transfer pattern


address $owner
address pendingOwner

function transferOwnership(address owner_) public virtual onlyOwner {
        pendingOwner = owner_;
        emit NewOwnershipTransferred();
    }

function acceptOwnership() external {
			require(msg.sender == pendingOwner, "!pendingOwner");
			$owner = pendingOwner;
			emit OwnershipTransferred()
			pendingOwner = address(0)
}
