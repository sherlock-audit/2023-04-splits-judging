# Looping over an unbounded array in PassThroughWalletImpl.sol can lead to the state of DoS.

## Summary

Looping over an unbounded array in PassThroughWalletImpl.sol in the passThroughTokens() function can lead to the state of DoS.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function passThroughTokens() takes in the address array of tokens and then looping over its length. Its visibility is also marked as external meaning the value of address[] calldata _tokens depends on the user input. This can lead to providing unexpectedly huge array by the user and breaking the whole function execution leading to the state of DoS. 

## Impact

The huge amount of addresses in the array can lead to the state of DoS of the function and impact later user interaction making the cost of the function too high to execute.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add some custom logic to mitigate the risk.
