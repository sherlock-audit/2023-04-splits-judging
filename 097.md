# The contract owner accidentally setting the paused state to the same value it was before.

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
There is possibility of the contract owner accidentally setting the paused state to the same value it was before. In such cases, the contract state would not change, and the owner may not realize the mistake, leading to potential issues.

## Impact
If the contract owner accidentally sets the paused state to its current value, the contract's functionality may not behave as expected, possibly causing security vulnerabilities, incorrect operation of the contract, or lost funds.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to replace the setPaused(bool) function with the setPaused() function described below, which toggles the paused state automatically. This change will reduce the likelihood of the contract owner accidentally setting the paused state to the same value it was before.

```solidity
function setPaused() public virtual onlyOwner {
    $paused = !$paused;
    emit SetPaused($paused);
}
```
