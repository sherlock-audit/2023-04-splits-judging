# No timelock mechanism in setDefaultScaledOfferFactor

## Summary

Owner could change scaledOfferFactor, while tx in mempool and new value could be bad for trader.

## Vulnerability Detail
* Trader call flash() function with low gas price
* Tx in mempool during 1 hours (for example)
* In this period owner of UniV3OracleImpl call setPairOverrides() with values, which is not ok for trader (for example scaledOfferFactor)
* Trader dont analize owner's tx and new value of scaledOfferFactor will be surprise for him, when tx has mined. Trader could get less tokens, than he planned.

## Impact
Owner could change scaledOfferFactor, while tx in mempool and new value could be bad for trader.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add timelock modifier in functions, which could change important values in contracts, such as setPairOverrides, when it calls for pair for the second time(change value). Not from initializer.
