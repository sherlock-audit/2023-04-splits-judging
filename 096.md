# Owner role lockout

## Summary

Owner role lockout due to typos/mistakes

## Vulnerability Detail

The `transferOwnership()` function in `OwnableImpl.sol` sets/updates owner role address in
one-step. If an incorrect address (zero address or other) is mistakenly used then future
owner access or even recovering from this mistake is prevented because all
`onlyOwner` modifier functions require msg.sender to be the incorrectly used
owner address (for which private keys may not be available to sign transactions). In such a
case, contracts would have to be redeployed. 

## Impact

All your client-side contracts (SwapperImpl, PassThroughWalletImpl) are inherited from `OwnableImpl.sol`
So if your users will accidentally set wrong address as owner (by calling `transferOwnership()`) -> they will lose control over their funds

For example:

1. Alice creates `SwapperImpl` and sets her company's treasury address as `$beneficiary`
2. Alice wants to transfer ownership to her manager and made a typo while copying managers's address 
3. Her company's treasury was hacked and Alice and her manager want to change address
4. It's impossible, because `owner` is wrong address

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use a two-step process where the current owner address first claims ownership changing in one transaction and a second transaction from the new owner address takes ownership
