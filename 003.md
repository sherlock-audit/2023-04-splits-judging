# an invalid transaction can cause entire transaction to revert in executeCall()

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The user can execute multiple calls at once using WalletImpl.executeCall(). However, due to the lack of revert handling for multi-calls, if one call fails, the entire call fails. This vulnerability can degrade the user's experience, create a situation where the user has to retry multiple times, and incur unnecessary gas costs.

Scenario

1. Alice wants to send ETH from her ETH wallet to another wallet address.
2. Alice uses the Multi-call feature to execute multiple calls at once, and expects them all to succeed.
3. However, if one call fails, the entire call fails due to Multi-call's lack of revert handling.
4. Alice has to find the cause of the failed call before she can try the call again, which is time-consuming and expensive.
5. In addition, the gas cost of retrying failed calls is also unnecessarily consumed.


## Impact
single invalid transaction can cause entire transaction to revert. Also the user must find the cause of the failed call before he can try again, which is time-consuming and expensive.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add event for failed transaction and notify user when transaction fail

```solidity
// introduce event for failed transaction
event ExecCallFailed(address to, uint256 msgValue, bytes data, string returnData); 

    function execCalls(Call[] calldata calls_)
        external
        payable
        onlyOwner
        returns (uint256 blockNumber, bytes[] memory returnData)
    {
        blockNumber = block.number;
        uint256 length = calls_.length;
        returnData = new bytes[](length);

        bool success;
        for (uint256 i; i < length;) {
            Call calldata calli = calls_[i];
            (success, returnData[i]) = calli.to.call{value: calli.value}(calli.data);
            if(!success) emit executFailed(calli.to, calli.value, calli.data, string(returnData[i])); // fail transaction handling
						
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }

        emit ExecCalls(calls_);
    }
```
