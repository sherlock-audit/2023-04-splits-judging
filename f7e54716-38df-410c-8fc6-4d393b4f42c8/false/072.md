# SwapperImpl.sol - uses one oracle source for flash

## Summary
swapper only uses one oracle source for flash.
## Vulnerability Detail
The oracle is supposed to be an array to support input of more oracle sources but it's not, more oracles can't be used and this is bad practice .
Using a centralized oracle source is bad practice, a DeFi security best practice is using a decentralized oracle network to find the true value of an exchange rate that reflects broad market coverage

## Impact
if the centralized oracle source is tampered with, there will be a lot of problems for this protocol. 
As functions that depend on the oracle will misbehave.
may result in catastrophic loss of funds.
