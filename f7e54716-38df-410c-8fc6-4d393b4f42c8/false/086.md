# Due to reaching a gas limit, the transaction of the PassThroughWalletImpl#`passThroughToken()` will be reverted

## Summary
The transaction will be reverted due to reaching a gas limit in the for-loop within the PassThroughWalletImpl#`passThroughToken()` if too many number of tokens would be assigned into the `tokens_` array parameter by a caller when the PassThroughWalletImpl#`passThroughToken()` would be called.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user send some funds (`tokens_`) to the `$passThrough` address, the PassThroughWalletImpl#`passThroughToken()` would be called.

Within the PassThroughWalletImpl#`passThroughToken()`, multiple tokens can be assigned via the `tokens_` array parameter and then each token would be transferred into the `_passThrough` by using for-loop like this:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-splits/blob/main/splits-pass-through-wallet/src/PassThroughWalletImpl.sol#L124-L128
```solidity
    /// send tokens_ to $passThrough
    function passThroughTokens(address[] calldata tokens_) external pausable returns (uint256[] memory amounts) { /// @audit
        address _passThrough = $passThrough;
        uint256 length = tokens_.length;
        amounts = new uint256[](length);
        for (uint256 i; i < length;) {  /// @audit
            address token = tokens_[i];
            uint256 amount = token._balanceOf(address(this));
            amounts[i] = amount;
            token._safeTransfer(_passThrough, amount);   /// @audit
            ...
        }
        ...
```

However, there is no limitation that how many number of tokens a caller can be assigned into the `tokens_` array parameter. 
This lead to reaching a gas limit and therefore this transaction will be reverted in the for-loop if a user assign too many number of tokens into the `tokens_` array parameter. 


## Impact
The transaction will be reverted due to reaching a gas limit in the for-loop within the PassThroughWalletImpl#`passThroughToken()`.

## Recommendation
Consider setting a limitation that how many number of tokens a caller can be assigned into the `tokens_` array parameter when the PassThroughWalletImpl#`passThroughToken()` would be called.
