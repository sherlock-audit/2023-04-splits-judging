# Loss of funds in SwapperImpl

## Summary

Loss of user's ETH in `SwapperImpl.flash()`

## Vulnerability Detail

Function `SwapperImpl.flash()` calls function `SwapperImpl._transferToBeneficiary()`
And there is check for `$_payback` variable if `token` is ETH:
```solidity
            if ($_payback < amountToBeneficiary_) {
                revert InsufficientFunds_FromTrader();
            }
            // @audit high если amount меньше, чем _payback, то мы его занулим, но при этом не весь эфир отправим
            $_payback = 0;
```

In the code above you just check that your `$_payback` value is more or equal to `amountToBeneficiary_`
And then you set it to 0. But the correct behaviour should be:
```solidity
            $_payback = $_payback - amountToBeneficiary_;
```
Because you withdraw only `amountToBeneficiary_`, not total `$_payback` value of ETH

## Impact

Loss of funds. E.g.:

1. Alice creates `SwapperImpl` with `$tokenToBeneficiary = ETH` and accumulates her business revenue there
2. She has 1 ETH on her balance 
3. Let's imagine that quote token is USDC and current ETH price is 1000 USDC
4. Malicious user calls `SwapperImpl.flash()` and wants to change his 500 USDT to 0.5 ETH from contract balance, so `amountToBeneficiary_ = 0.5e18` and `$_payback = 1e18`
5. `$_payback` is more than  `amountToBeneficiary_ ` so all checks passed
6. But then you set  `$_payback` to 0
7. Alice gets her 0.5 ETH because she is `$beneficiary`
8. Now she wants to withdraw the rest of her ETH (0.5 ETH) and she can't do it, because now the check `$_payback >= amountToBeneficiary_` fails

Result: Alice lost her funds

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove `$_payback` variable
Use just current `address(this).balance`. It's enough
