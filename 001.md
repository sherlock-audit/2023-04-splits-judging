# POSSIBLE LOSS OF OWNERSHIP

## Summary
POSSIBLE LOSS OF OWNERSHIP
## Vulnerability Detail

When transferring ownership of the protocol, no checks are performed
on whether the new address is valid and active. In case there is a mistake
when transferring ownership, the whole protocol may lose all of its
ownership functionalities.
```solidity
    function transferOwnership(address owner_) public virtual onlyOwner {
        $owner = owner_;
        emit OwnershipTransferred(msg.sender, owner_);
    }

```

## Impact

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The transfer of ownership process should be split into two different
transactions, the first one calling the requestTransferOwnership function
which proposes a new owner for the protocol, and the second one, the new
owner accepts the proposal by calling acceptsTransferOwnership function.
