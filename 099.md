# RETRACTED - flash() should not be payable

## Summary
[`SwapperImpl.flash()` is payable](https://github.com/0xSplits/splits-swapper/blob/6b64cdbba099050c16a02e997a5ae263a2d7dacc/src/SwapperImpl.sol#L203) but any ETH sent in is not accounted for in the function logic.

## Vulnerability Detail
Although payable, the `flash()` function does not account for received ETH in the calculations of the flash trade.
All ETH payment for `flash()` transaction must go through payback() to be credited. 

## Impact
Results in loss of trader ETH.
If `tokenToBeneficiary` is ETH, it gets swept as excess to the beneficiary. Otherwise, it stays in the Swapper.
