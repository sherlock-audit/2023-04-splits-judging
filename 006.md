# PassThroughWalletImpl can accept address(0x0) as owner

## Summary
PassThroughWalletImpl contract can accept address(0x0) as owner after which passthrough will lose ability to manage passthrough

## Vulnerability Detail
The owner of PassThroughWalletImpl is set via initializer() function. PassThroughWalletFactory.createPassThroughWallet() is an external function to which the initial params are passed. Of that list, owner is also a parameter.

The call flows down from factory to PassThroughWalletImpl.initializer() which inturn calls __initOwnable() of OwnableImpl contract.
In this whole, there is no check to ensure address(0x0) is not passed.

## Impact
Once the address(0x0) is set, the transfer of ownership is not possible and hence the default values on the passthrough can never be managed to call setPassThrough function.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
check in OwnableImpl.__initOwnable() where before setting, it checks for incoming value to be a valid one before setting the owner in the storage
