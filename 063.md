# _getquoteAmount may not return the correct quote due to differences in tick size

## Summary

The function _getquoteamount may not return the correct quote due to difference in tick sizes in pools.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function _getquoteamount calls the UniswapV3factory to get the pool by entering the 2 tokens and the fee ($defaultFee) shown here.

 These parameters are then used to call getQuoteAtTick.

Defaultfee is an arbitrary function that can be set by the owner shown here:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-splits/blob/main/splits-oracle/src/UniV3OracleImpl.sol#L149-L152

However a UniswapV3 pool tick size differs depending on the fee. So there is a chance that the function will not return the correct quote for token pairs. Here is an except from their whitepaper

As well as the docs

"Due to the nature of the v3 smart contracts, tick spacing is directly correlated to the swap fee. Lower fee tiers allow closer potentially active ticks, and higher fees allow a relatively wider spacing of potential active ticks."

## Impact

_getquoteamount may not return the best quote for token pair
