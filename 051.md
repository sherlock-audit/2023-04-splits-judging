# Missing zero check for $passThrough could lead to funds loss

## Summary
`PassThroughWalletImpl` is not protected from zero addresses for `$passThrough` variable. In case of `setPassThrough` execution with default value - user could lost all funds, as anyone can execute `passThroughTokens` and burn tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
To reproduce this issue owner of `PassThroughWalletImpl` must specify `$passThrough` as zero address, which is technically possible, but not expected to be an often case.
In this case owner of wallet could lost all funds, as `passThroughTokens` function is not protected by access control, so anyone can send all tokens to zero address.

## Impact
In case of such mistake user could lost all funds. Attacker would have a zero profit of it.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function test_passThroughZeroAddress_burnOthersTokens() public unpaused {
      vm.prank(initParams.owner);
      //Owner by mistake set pass through as zero address
      passThroughWallet.setPassThrough(address(0));

      uint256 preBalancesWallet = tokens[0]._balanceOf(address(passThroughWallet));
      uint256 preBalancesAddressZero = tokens[0]._balanceOf(address(0));

      //Attacker executes passThroughTokens when passThrough is zero address to burn user's tokens
      passThroughWallet.passThroughTokens(tokens);

      //Verify, that user lost tokens and they are moved to zero address (eg burned)
      assertEq(tokens[0]._balanceOf(address(0)), preBalancesWallet);
      assertEq(tokens[0]._balanceOf(address(passThroughWallet)), 0);
 }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review, PoC test

## Recommendation
Implement zero checks to prevent `$passThrough` being zero. 
Modify `PassThroughWalletImpl.initializer()` function by adding:
```solidity
require(params_.passThrough != address(0), "PathThrough must be initialized");
```
And `PassThroughWalletImpl.setPassThrough` function by adding:
```solidity
require(passThrough_ != address(0), "PathThrough must be initialized");
```
