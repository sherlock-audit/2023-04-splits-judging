# flash() does not account for $_payback properly, as a result, _transferToBeneficiary() might revert even though there is sufficient balance to cover ``amountToBeneficiary_``.

## Summary
flash() does not account for $_payback properly, as a result, _transferToBeneficiary() might revert even though theis is sufficient balance to cover ``amountToBeneficiary_``. 

## Vulnerability Detail
``flash()`` allows third parties to withdraw tokens in return for sending tokenToBeneficiary to beneficiary. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-splits/blob/main/splits-swapper/src/SwapperImpl.sol#L203-L221](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-splits/blob/main/splits-swapper/src/SwapperImpl.sol#L203-L221)

Since the function is ``payable``, it allows the user to send eth to the contract as ``payback``, however, in contrast to the function ``payback()``, which keeps track of the amount in ``$_payback``, the function does not change the value of ``$_payback``.

```javascript
  function payback() external payable {
        $_payback += msg.value.toUint96();
        emit Payback(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }
```

Meanwhile, the function calls ``_transferToBeneficiary()`` to send tokens to the beneficiary. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-splits/blob/main/splits-swapper/src/SwapperImpl.sol#L218](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-splits/blob/main/splits-swapper/src/SwapperImpl.sol#L218)

Since ``$_payback`` is not properly accounted above, when the tokens to be sent is ETH, the condition ``$_payback < amountToBeneficiary_`` is not properly tested. As a result, even though there is enough balance to cover ``amountToBeneficiary_``, the function might still revert. 

```javascript
 if (tokenToBeneficiary_._isETH()) {
            if ($_payback < amountToBeneficiary_) {
                revert InsufficientFunds_FromTrader();
            }
            $_payback = 0;

            // send eth to beneficiary
            uint256 ethBalance = address(this).balance;
            excessToBeneficiary = ethBalance - amountToBeneficiary_;
            _beneficiary.safeTransferETH(ethBalance);
```

## Impact
``$_payback`` is not properly accounted in ``flash()``, as a result, ``_transferToBeneficiary()`` might fail even though there is sufficient balance to cover ``amountToBeneficiary_``.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Keep track of ``$_payback`` properly in ``flash()``:

```diff
function flash(OracleImpl.QuoteParams[] calldata quoteParams_, bytes calldata callbackData_)
        external
        payable
        pausable
    {


+       $_payback += msg.value.toUint96();
+        emit Payback(msg.sender, msg.value);

        address _tokenToBeneficiary = $tokenToBeneficiary;
        (uint256 amountToBeneficiary, uint256[] memory amountsToBeneficiary) =
            _transferToTrader(_tokenToBeneficiary, quoteParams_);

        ISwapperFlashCallback(msg.sender).swapperFlashCallback({
            tokenToBeneficiary: _tokenToBeneficiary,
            amountToBeneficiary: amountToBeneficiary,
            data: callbackData_
        });

        uint256 excessToBeneficiary = _transferToBeneficiary(_tokenToBeneficiary, amountToBeneficiary);

        emit Flash(msg.sender, quoteParams_, _tokenToBeneficiary, amountsToBeneficiary, excessToBeneficiary);
    }
```
