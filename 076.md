# Swappers owner could possibly receive less token than what they should receive (i.e. loss of funds)

## Summary
UniV3 Oracle is used to get a TWAP based price. This price is used to perform the trade. However, inaccuracy of TWAP price could possibly occur during price volatility (which is not unsual in the crypto world). This eventually causes the Swapper owner to receive less token than what he/she should receive.

## Vulnerability Detail
`_getQuoteAmount` method gets **unscaledAmountToBeneficiary** from Uniswap oracle.

```solidity
	uint256 unscaledAmountToBeneficiary = OracleLibrary.getQuoteAtTick({
		tick: arithmeticMeanTick,
		baseAmount: quoteParams_.baseAmount,
		baseToken: cqp.cBase,
		quoteToken: cqp.cQuote
	});
```

It is possible that the TWAP price is stale and as there is no slip price check engorced as a safety, Swapper owner could possibly lose funds due to the inaccuracy of price. i.e. Swapper owner will receive less tokens and the trader will receive more which is a loss to Swapper owner.

## Impact
Swapper owner will receive less tokens and the trader will receive more. In other words, Swapper owner will have a loss of funds.

## Recommendation

Add a method for Swapper owner only allowing him/her to set a minimum price. Use this addtional check after getting the price from Oracle.
