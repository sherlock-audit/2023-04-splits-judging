# On _repayLoan the totalRepaid.principal and totalRepaid.interest calculated incorrectly

## Summary
You can see _repayLoan function is being called by repayLoan at [L649](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller-evokid/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L649-L654) which is passing owedPrincipal + interest as `_owedAmount` inside `_repayLoan` function, and principal and interest as `_payment` .
```solidity
_repayLoan(
		_bidId,
		Payment({ principal: _amount - interest, interest: interest }),
		owedPrincipal + interest,
		true
	);
```

and inside _repayLoan function:
```solidity
function _repayLoan(
	uint256 _bidId,
	Payment memory _payment,
	uint256 _owedAmount,
	bool _shouldWithdrawCollateral
) internal virtual {
```

the issue here at [L754](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller-evokid/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L754-L755) that `totalRepaid.principal` and `totalRepaid.interest` in bid.loanDetails calculated incorrectly.
```solidity
	bid.loanDetails.totalRepaid.principal += _payment.principal;
	bid.loanDetails.totalRepaid.interest += _payment.interest;
```


## Vulnerability Detail
Inside  _repayLoan function the `paymentAmount` was calculated as `_payment.principal + _payment.interest` , then at [L727](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller-evokid/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L727-L728) you can see the `_owedAmount` is assigned to `paymentAmount` if paymentAmount is equal or greater than _owedAmount which makes sense to transfer the only  _owedAmount later to the lender.
 ```solidity
if (paymentAmount >= _owedAmount) {
            paymentAmount = _owedAmount;
_payment.interest_payment.interest;
```

It stores _payment.principal and _payment.interest directly without calculating the right values for them according to paymentAmount (which is _owedAmount), **because paymentAmount might be greater than _owedAmount** when it was assigned at [L728](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller-evokid/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L728) `paymentAmount = _owedAmount;`

In other words **totalRepaid.principal** and **totalRepaid.interest** should be adjusted according to `_owedAmount` value if required and not storing them directly as they come within `_payment`. 

## Impact
Incorrect values stored in totalRepaid for principal and interest might affect the protocol wherever those values used for other calculations.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
How to adjust values in case paymentAmount > _owedAmount:
```solidity
bid.loanDetails.totalRepaid.principal = _owedAmount - _payment.interest;
bid.loanDetails.totalRepaid.interest = _owedAmount -_payment.principal;
```
